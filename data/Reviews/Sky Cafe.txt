Reviews:

- I've been wanting to try out this place for years, and finally gave it a visit recently. I love the rustic "coffee shop" look of the place. The staff were very helpful and attentive. I had to try their nasi lemak (coconut rice) and boy I tell you, it was delicious! While every nasi lemak is a little different and people have different tastes, this definitely reminds me of some of the better ones I've had. I also wanted to try out their mie rebus, but unfortunately they did not have it when I visited. I will definitely return to try out other items on their menu. (5 stars)

- One bite of this nasi goreng and I was taken back to the
countless times I spent eating Nasi Goreng on Bali
beaches. A friend brought me here and I was so happy
with the price, portions, and taste! Rice was cooked
perfectly and the sweet sausages inside balanced out
the flavors. I will absolutely be coming back. (4 stars)

- Favorite Indonesian Restaurant in the area. Prices are not bad, $ 8-13 range for most dishes. Where do I begin? I've tried most fo the menu. Beef Iga, Mie Complit, Nasi Padang, and Nasi Campur Medan are my favorites. For apps I would go with the chicken or pork Satay. The food comes out relatively fast and service is mostly friendly.

Only thing I don't like is they have 4% credit fee now so bring cash if you want to avoid this extra expense.

The parking lot is very small for the amount of restaurants & stores, so be ready to street park it. (5 stars)
