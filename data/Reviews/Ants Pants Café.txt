Tips:

- cash only $$$$
- I had the maple bacon and it might have been the best sandwich I have ever eaten!
- a brunch so early it is, in fact, breakfast.
- The staff is not very friendly and it's overpriced.
- Super friendly staff and delicious breakfasts...get there early for a table!
- Okay food's okay but the hipster unfriendly attitude is what I'm really tired of whenever I walk in. I used to frequent this joint but upon realizing the unfriendliness I gave myself a break. Remember that no matter how shitty a place is, it's about the "brotherly love" man. You ain't got it snobs.
- Slow
- Great service, delicious food, cash only, tight space
- Beef Hash is the way to go! Beef sautéed in tomatoes and onions over shoestring fries topped with sunny side up eggs and homemade ranch. Excellent!
- Great little breakfast spot.
- Don't forget to bring cash, they don't accept cards. Highly recommend the coffee, pancakes, and eggs benedict.
- Amazing tomatoes and eggs! And I normally HATE tomatoes! I only eat them for the licopene.
- In the former Don Quixote.
- Get the coffee - it's bottomless and really tasty!
- Goat cheese omelette
- The scramble is always delicious!
- Stopped in for a quick lunch. Great salad and prompt service.
- limit your group to 4, larger than that you won't be seated together
- 'The Lot' - French toast, bacon, scrambled eggs- goodness

- Opening a second location in Queen Village in April.
- Get here early tables fill up fast
- Thinking about the bacon stack makes me drool a little. Go try it.
- Try their seasonal specials! I had their Chai Tea pancakes and they were SO DELICIOUS. Wait time for our food was really long... and we went there at 1:30 pm when it wasn't super crowded compared to brunch rush.
- Nothing beats brunch on a holiday!
- Always order the sweet potato fries. Always.
- Egg, cheese, maple bacon on a long roll. Happy Sunday to me.
- Weather permitting try to get a seat outside in the back.   More room and not so loud.  Great coffee and the salmon platter is terrific.
- Delicious grilled cheese with tomato and bacon!
- The place is pretty small so the wait can be longer if you are in a group of 2 or more people!

Reviews:

- walked in, busy vibes, we knew that was a good sign. Bustling! Everyone that works here is pretty cute and has gages (edgy). I went with my sneaky link and he called one the workers a hunk, I was thinking the same thing. I ordered the beef hash and my sneaky link ordered the Italian sausage white bean special with eggs. When we got our drinks (a mocha and a coffee) The waiter noticed that my sneaky link was jealous of my whipped cream and brought him his own little cup of whipped cream! How nice! The food took a good minute to come out, but let me tell you, it was delicious, the flavors melted together and created a wonderland. Looking forward to making this a regular spot. Not cheap but not insanely expensive, bill was 50$ for 2. (4 stars)
