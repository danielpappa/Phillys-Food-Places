Reviews:

- Old-school city-club dining, open to the public. Simple, classic, understated, elegant. Live jazz piano and string bass duo make this the hands-down Rittenhouse destination for swill, swank, and steak!

RITTENHOUSE 
Tucked neatly at the corner of the Warwick Hotel (and Residences) on the ground floor, at 17th and Locust. 
This is the spot you take your colleagues, your friends, your partner, your fiancé (or make it so, right here), or even your federal judge friend (because you aren't actually a member of the Union League).
RG will host you and your party to make you properly proud!

AMBIENCE
Dark wood paneling with brass accents, studded black leather chairs, white tablecloths, majestic floral topiaries, and
"King" highback chairs for host that anchor each table. Cool. 
Dave Posmontier jazz piano and string bass duo. Puts RG steps above all the rest.
Style and sophistication the way it used to be before piped-in bubbly Boublé and Sinatra became the norm. 
Bravo!

SERVICE
I want to say casual and not overdone, but that means it's a massive operation running everything perfectly. 
Smooth, not rushed or frantic, well-staffed, well-groomed and tailored. 
Auto-gratuity at 20% is well deserved, and is not concealed, but notably mentioned on the menu, reminded verbally by your server, and underscored on your bill. Well done!

SWILL
Barmen doing the classics, exactly the way they should be. No frilly and confusing yet daring mixology, just solid and staunch, tradition. 
Classic wine list with bests and recognizable favorites for each style. 

STEAK
Mine was a simple chopped steak, served in its juices and topped with grilled onion. Delicious. 
But the steak fries! Oh my. Absolutely perfectly prepared and cooked. 
My starter was a Caesar salad with anchovies. 
Dessert was a teeming and delectable cup of raspberry sorbet. 

DETAIL
Black cloth napkins by default. Because everyone is wearing dark clothes. None of this change out from white hoity toity. 
I could go on and on. Just GO. (5 stars)
