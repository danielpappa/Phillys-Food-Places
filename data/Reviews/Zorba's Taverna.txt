Reviews:

- Zorba's is always my choice for comfort food. No, I'm not Greek but there's something utterly cozy about eating in the little back room, especially on a muggy summer afternoon, that satisfies me like few other places in Philly can. It's an intangible feeling of being transported out of the ordinary. No, I have never been to Greece, so it's not that 'hey presto!' it suddenly feels like dining on the Aegean coast. If pressed, I'd have to say eating in that little dining room is, for me, rather like how it must have felt when the Pevensie kids in C.S. Lewis' Narnia classic stepped out of the back of that wardrobe. Plain and simple-having a feeling of being Elsewhere. I'll add that I have eaten outside here more than half a dozen times, but it's just not the same. I see, feel and know that I am on a major street in Philadelphia. The food tastes just as good, the service is the same as indoors but for me, there's just no magic. 

And as to the food...I never go here alone because when in the company of one or more friends, ample opportunity to try more food abounds. We always order at least one cold appetizer plate and depending on how many of us are dining, it's not unusual to order a second one along with additional pita bread. The pita is always tender and warm. It's the ultimate scooper for the delicious and well seasoned dips which we mix and match, always claiming our most recent mashup combo is the ultimate best. Hummus is something I tend to shun (yes, even Zahav's version) but for some reason, I scarf the stuff at Zorba's like a mad stoner. The horitaki is also a staple and as much as I disdain feta cheese, it is salty refreshment in this Greek salad. The Imam Baldi is a pleasing, solid version of the classic eggplant dish and there is something touchingly and ridiculously homey about those potatoes served with it. 

If we're still feeling capable of eating without slipping into a food coma under the white table cloth, the charcoaled sampler for 2, which consists of pork kabob, chicken kabob, marinated chicken breast, two rack lamb chops, homemade sausage and gyro joins our groaning table and has something to please all the omnivores. Is this 'authentic' Greek cuisine like Yia Yia makes? Can't say, never been to Greece and don't particularly care. There has never been a time in 7 years that I've had a less than stellar meal here and that IS saying something. 

Zorba's is byob and a bottle of retsina, a bottle of raki and one of ouzo will complement everything on the menu. Sure, beer will, too-but I really find it too filling with all the carbonation. Save room for the food!

Service is always prompt but rather impersonal. That's okay with me. Sometimes I just want to eat and don't feel a need to bond with the server. That is not to say I have ever been treated discourteously here. Not at all. The folks working here do their jobs and they do them efficiently and well. 

Never tried the baklava though fellow eaters swoon over it with their after dinner Greek coffee.  I can heartily vouch for the rice pudding. Sometimes (okay-usually) I have to order it to go. That way I can savor it as a late night treat or a day after decadent breakfast with a pot of flowery jasmine or oolong tea.

Zorba's Taverna offers affordable, well made, plentiful, delicious food and convival surroundings in the magic little dining room. It's one of my top five favorite places in the city to dine or celebrate with friends. (5 stars)

- I was dining with my friend who is from Greece and claims that this is his favorite place in the city for Greek food. I had the stuffed pepper and tomato because I was in a veggie kind of mood. It was good. Deep flavors and satisfying. Most of the table got the lamb chops because they had all been here before and knew exactly what they wanted. I sampled one from my friend's dish. They were delicious. We had a variety of appetizers... all good. The baked feta especially. Service was great as well as the atmosphere. Zorba's is the real deal. (4 stars)

- My husband and I ate dinner her before going on a tour. It isn't a huge place but it is definitely a local spot that was pretty busy. Without a reservation we were still able to be sat right away. I ordered a chicken gyro platter which came with veggies and rice. I enjoyed my meal. The service was excellent. A couple police officers even stopped in to grab dinner. You know if the police are eating there the place is great! I would highly recommend giving them a try! (5 stars)
