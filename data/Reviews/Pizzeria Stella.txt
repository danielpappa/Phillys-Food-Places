Tips:

- Get the egg and truffle tartufo
- Gets crowded after 6pm, wait staff attentiveness goes down. Better off sitting at the bar.
- meatball Tuesday is a must for anyone looking for a great deal. Pick your meatball and soup or salad for $15.
- Awesome drinks and service. We sat at the bar and our bartender was super friendly and really took his time making our drinks despite how packed it was. He really takes pride in his work.

- arrived at 5:30 to an empty restaurant was told there was a 40 minute wait and sent to the bar.  70 minutes later seated. There was no explanation for why we were made to stand next to empty tables for such a long time with starving children. My guess is to buy the $13 wine served in water glasses.
- Great pizza. Incredible atmosphere in Olde City.
- Tartufo pizza here is wonderful.  Black truffle, two cheeses and egg.  Incredible!
- Fast service, great, comfortable layout and design. Excellent, unique pizza with full-flavored salads. Limited beer selection, but more than enough for me. We'll be back.

Reviews:

- While staying at a hotel nearby, we ordered some pizzas through Doordash. We got a margherita pizza and a spinach pizza. Both were wonderful! We also got an order of marinated olives. Citrus and garlicky and not overly oily. Yum! The highlight of the pizzas was definitely the crust. It was perfect. The Margherita pizzas was delightful but had a couple slices that were unbearably salty for some bizarre reason. The spinach pizza was very good! They're large personal pizzas and aren't very heavy so keep that in mind when ordering! (4 stars)

- This place definitely hits the spot at all the right notes for my pizza craving. I was torn between the sausage pizza and Margherita at first, but ultimately decided to go with the former. My order arrived a bit less than hot, but that's to be expected on a day when there's a flurry of snow outside. After popping a slice into the oven for a hot minute, it was ooh-la-la so damn good to eat. The thin crust barely held the weight of the sauce and toppings but I actually don't mind it. Can't wait to try the other toppings next time. (5 stars)
