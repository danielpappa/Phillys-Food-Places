Reviews:

- This place is very unethical. The online menu states that the royal tavern burger come with fries but when I went to pick it up, they told me it doesn't anymore. Either update your online menu or treat me fairly and include it for me. I didn't even get the mayo either that's was well known for the royal tavern burger. They also wrap the burger in aluminum foil and by the time i got home, the bread is soggy and unedible. Check the picture and see that glistening water pool on top. I have emailed them and just received a snorky response saying I should have told them to box it when that's what they did before without asking. They also say the fries were taken out for the online ordering. However their website still states it comes with fries and the mayo. Like I say, very unethical practice to make a buck. (1 stars)

- History, history, history. How long has this place been here? I swear the bar itself must've come off a scuttled galleon. 

Great music, great vibes, fun staff, a stone's throw from the water.

Great libations! What more could you possibly want? (5 stars)
