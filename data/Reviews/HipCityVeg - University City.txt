Tips:

- Love its sweet potato fires and the Frossie!
- Sweet potato fries
- Finally vegetarian/vegan options that are not doused with garlic and red peppers at every turn!  Hard to find so THANK YOU!! The portaBella sandwich was DeLish! and the rest of the menu looks awesome too.  Can't wait to try more items.
- Shakes
- Awesome service....
- Love the Philly steak...I can get me fix!
- Banana whip!
- Try the fries..... so good...
- Hip City Veg is a great restaurant! Be sure to ask to sample the "Groothie" in case you are new to green smoothies. This Groothie is delicious because it is so well blended; you do not taste the greens, it is filling, and naturally sweet because of the banana and apple. 
The Bistro Bella sandwich is delicious. I enjoy eating at Hip City Veg because they have a variety of items on the menu and eating a plant based diet doesn't leave one feeling sluggish!
- I like that they're open till 11 PM, I only hope that they treat their workers well.
- Boo closed for technical difficulties for at least an hour.
- Sweet potato fries and the milk shakes will make you want to slap your mama.

- Buffalo up the crispy chicken ranch :)
- Philly cheesesteak!
- Green lemonade good for hangover lol.... side of sweet potato fries

- Start with the Crispy Hip City Ranch then move your way through the menu.

- You can get any sandwich as a salad. The hip city ranch is great on arugula!
- Sweet potato fries are hot and crunchy and so good
- Cupcakes are great
- Crispy hipcity ranch bufflo sauce a must have for vegan....
- I love hip city but the prices went up and it really is overpriced now $$$ I'll still come here but definitely not as frequently.
- Music is always unpredictable :)
- Best Sweet potato fries ever. Tried with Sriracha Aioli
- The chocolate shakes taste like brownie batter, which is amazing.  Chocolate mint shakes (seasonal in March) are even better!
- definitely try the banana whip! it's a healthy, vegan alternative to the Ben & Jerry offerings next door.
- Cute, clean and great menu of fresh foods, smoothies and sweets too!

- Not a vegan,vegetarian but definitely a regular. Food is so good. Consistently awesome and fast. Soy chocolate milkshakes are the truth!!!!
- banana whip
- The Banana Whips is amazing! I couldn't believe it wasn't ice cream
- Plastic to go cups, made from corn, What?!
- A muuuuch nicer space than the Rittenhouse location!
- The milkshakes are great but you could just buy Gardein and make it at home for half the price. That's what the food is, basically.
- They have a really large table in the middle of the space, if you dont mind sitting with people you dont know and dont mind making friend or have a large group its really cute!

- Sweet potato fries bangin'
- BEST sweet potato fries I've had! Siracha aioli is amazing!!
- Decent
- Even takes Dragon card from Drexel!
- It tastes good
- The sweet potato fries were very good. Both the crispy ranch (faux chicken) and buffalo portabella sandwiches were great - even for us non-vegetarians.
- Great vegan cheesesteak.  Love the vegan milkshakes too!
- Their nuggets are good
- Better than expected! The jerk chicken salad is good!
- Burgers are delicious and well priced. The salads, not so much. Much bigger than the Rittenhouse location.

Reviews:

- This place is absolutely awful. It's overpriced and the burgers are totally inedible. My stomach hurt instantly!! The pictures online are so deceiving, when they give you a burger that looks like a thin slice of cardboard and a plastic bun. I will never eat here again. (1 stars)
