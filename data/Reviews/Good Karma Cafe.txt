- Now with fishtank for extra karma
- Creative seasonal drinks and lots of tables for studying!
- If you're there to study, I'd avoid sitting at the table closest to the bathrooms.  I think it's a pretty distracting spot because you can literally feel every stomp of each persons that walks by.
- Try the "Tropic of Chai" while still in season (honey vanilla chai with coconut flavor). It was INCREDIBLE!

- Lavender iced latte special. Delicious and refreshing!
- Try the Black & White latte...nice!
- The best latte!
- Cash only, but there's an ATM on site.
- Free, strong WiFi
- Great outdoor area on a nice day.
- Great location! Very academic inside. I mean VERY!! My friend and I were sitting there talking and we felt like we were disturbing everybody else. So, I would say great spot for studying, but not to talk and catch up with your buddies over a cup of coffee. I feel like the service here is a bit unfriendly though.
- Coffee, sweet treats also vegan options and art on the walls! All good!
- If you buy a travel mug for $20, you get $1 coffee refills in it at any of their locations. Really convenient for those looking to save a little time and money during the day, and it reduces waste, too!
