- 一般般吧，可能是口味不同的缘故，性价比也一般，不算小费三十刀一个人吧。随便吃吃，环境有点吵的说。咖喱味比较重，服务员好像也不是很热情。
- Although the food was really delicious, we were shocked with the exorbitant cost of the bill. Expect to pay DOUBLE whatever you're thinking, and tip will be included in the bill. Also service was spotty at best. The waitress we had was very sweet, but the kitchen sent out our main courses without the accompanying rice, which reached the table ten minutes after. Not good. Really good food but unfortunately, not worth a return trip.
- Love the cute atmosphere inside this place and food is delicious (:
- Live sitar music while I brunch? Yes, please!!
- Good food but, I had the lamb chop small platter, tasted good but was too small
- Their Spinach Chaat is the best spinach I've ever had in my entire life. And that's saying a lot because I'm picky & hate spinach.
- The food was really good. I definitely would go back. Highly recommended!!
- So great! I'll be back!

Lamb Chops are the best!!

Reviews:

- I went to indieblue a few years ago for happy hour, and found it pretty lack luster at the time. But our last few visits were great. The food was creative and tasty (just stay way from the chicken and waffles, or you'll be really disappointed), that every time I come back  I like to branch out on the menu to be surprised. 

The drinks were really good, and the service was phenomenal. The staff all around was extremely friendly  and welcoming, gave samples of new drinks they were trying out, made accommodations for our toddlers without being asked, and we really enjoyed our time there.

So it's made a spot on the few restaurants we place on rotation for our nights out, (5 stars)

- Attempted to come here for happy hour, but they only allow you to do it if you're sitting at the bar. No seats were open so my group of friends and I did restaurant week instead, which was worth it. 

We all purposely ordered different items so we could all share. We ordered the demitasse soup, spinach chaat, crab corn tikki served with sweet chili aioli, "butter chicken" poutine, chicken korma, makhani, kheer, toasted coconut gulab jamun and chocolate pot de crème.

Everything tasted amazing with a nice blend of various spices. Definitely modern Indian cuisine but still very good and worth a try! 

The dishes that stood out were the spinach chaat, crab corn cake, chicken korma, and chocolate pot de creme! 

The decor is on point and it is a nice and small intimate restaurant with friendly service. Out of the 3 desserts, my friends and I all agreed that the chocolate cake
Was the best. Kheer was similar to rice pudding and delicious, but too liquidy and runny. Naan bread is also on point and amazing to dip with. 10/10 (5 stars)

- Tried for restaurant week. It was good services were nice and staff was phenomenal. I got paneer and poutine fries. As well as a Chai sangria. The Chai sangria wasn't worth it and the fries didn't have enough cheese curds. The paneer was okay. But I have had better Indian. However the location isn't bad right next to the patco (4 stars)

- My girlfriend and I came here for lunch on New Year's Day after spending the night in the city for New Years. They have great options and a wonderful lunch special which gives you a very nice spread of a few options. I tried something I've never had before and it was excellent and so was my girlfriend's lunch special platter.

As you walk in there is a bar, on the smaller side but a fancy size to fit the restaurant, and then the dining tables are set deeper into the building as you walk through the bar area. 

The entire restaurant is very cute and the wait staff was very attentive and courteous. The only reason I leave four stars over five is for the bathrooms. They were clean but not as clean cut as I had expected for how the restaurant looked. They could use a little facelift in my opinion to keep up the classy look of the rest of the restaurant.

If you are in the area you should certainly stop in. I'd love to return and sit at the bar for food and a drink. (4 stars)

- Really amazing happy hour!!! 

I stumbled upon this place just walking around through Center City one evening and I'm glad I did. Each visit, I meet an incredible new person, try a new food item and overall just grateful to experience such a great time! 

The staff is phenomenal. Each time I come in, I have a great experience with staff from the host, bartender and management. 

I recommend the Crispy Spinach Chaat and Tikka Naan Pizza! (4 stars)

- i was here last night on a date .im not from the city .everything was amazing. lori was so swet and made amazing suggestions.gia was so nice and friendly. can't wait to come back to the city and stop in again (5 stars)

- I came here after being told by many people that it's an amazing Indian spot. 

I came here with some friends and inside it is decorated very nicely. The vibes are homey. 

We ordered happy hour drinks which were great and were ready to order our food. What upset me from the start was that our waiter looked at his watch when we told him we needed a minute to finalize our dishes. 

Then after we ordered and our food came, the server dropped my rice all over the table. They apologized, but they did not clean the mess or give me New rice. I assumed they would given the fact that my rice was everywhere and inedible. I waited about 10 minutes but I was forgotten. I had to ask someone to remove the soiled rice and give me new rice. 

Because of the service I received, I couldn't enjoy my meal for what it is. All I remember is that the drinks tasted good HAHA. It's upsetting that there was zero care for my experience overall. 

Maybe it was a bad day, but I had expected better. (2 stars)
