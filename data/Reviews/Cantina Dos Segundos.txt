- Manager just accommodated a trio that so far have been asking for a game out of market, in which the crowd was watching a local game and now have to watch on the smaller tv, they are telling the bartender how to make the bars standard drinks. C'mon. Wait until they see that bill... I'm sure they'll complain and get something off.. If I'm here still I'll have the conclusion.
