Reviews:

- I took my friend here on a Saturday night for restaurant week, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Good ambiance and service inside. The filet mignon and salmon were absolutely spectacular. I'll be coming back soon! (5 stars)

- The crab cakes were great, however we were seated at a very small table and most of the stuff was falling off. The rest of the food, the fish tacos, gumbo soup and lobster rolls were not good. The lobster rolls were small with just dry bread and corn and you couldn't taste the lobster. Same goes with the shrimp tacos, each taco had exactly 2 pieces of small shrimp. However have to say that our waitress was very sweet but would not recommend the food. (3 stars)
