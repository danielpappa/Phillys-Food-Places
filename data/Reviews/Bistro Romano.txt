- Went here for my birthday with a bunch of my friends and family for the murder mystery dinner and it was HORRIBLE!!! I was so embarrassed because I selected this place and everyone paid a significant amount of money for less than mediocre food. Dinner was bland, dessert was disgusting, and the acting was like a high school play. And don't get me started on the tip envelopes labeled with all of our names....tacky.

Reviews:

- The atmosphere here is very cool, although (and I hate to sound old) I wish the lights were a little higher. The menu was expansive and everything looked amazing, so we had a hard time narrowing down our order. The mussels were insane - we were fighting over the sauce afterward. We tried almost every pasta but the short rib ravioli was the table favorite.  This was one of the more expensive meals I've had in Philly so I would recommend saving for a special occasion & with so many great options I think I would do the tasting menu next time. (4 stars)

- Never a bad night here! We were seated upstairs which was just as nice as the bottom floors. More light and simpler ambiance but still very beautiful. We all did the restaurant week menu, and everything was delicious. The gnocchi is perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. The burrata and mushroom soup were also both delicious. The white chocolate budino was absolutely perfect and I left wanting about 15 more. 10/10 recommend amazing date spot! (5 stars)

- The food was good, but the bread was amazing. I will come back for the bread. The plating was very elegant, but I was looking for something more delicate in the plating of my gnocchi. However, the food is absolutely wonderful and I will be coming back next time I'm in Philly. (5 stars)
