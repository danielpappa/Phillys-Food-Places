Reviews:

- Make sure to bring your vaccination card or have it on your phone! We got the chicken and waffles and stuffed french toast. They were both amazing! The portions are huge too. Definitely a mist visit if you're in the area. Parking is plenty around the block. (4 stars)

- Great brunch spot. There's a wide range of more unique brunch items outside of just eggs and potatoes and everything is made with a little more pizazz than the average diner. There was constantly a wait because of how popular it is.

Chicken & waffles - nice and crispy chicken that's not too dry and crispy waffle. It's served in a bowl which makes cutting the waffles hard and the syrup drain to the bottom waffles so I would've preferred a plate.  Recommend pouring the syrup as you eat to not make the waffles too soggy. Syrup is not very viscous but tastes good. Decent portion size but not to make you overly bloated or with leftovers to take home. 

Staff was relatively attentive despite it being very busy. Not super personable but not an issue. 

For those with Covid concerns - they check for vaccination BUT the seating is pretty close to one another so not the best distancing arrangement. Also the booths are small so even sitting with your party feels somewhat squished.

Service: 4.5/5
Food: 5/5
Ambience 4/5 (4 stars)

- Food was great and super fast!   We ordered French toast which was perfect for 2 people and a delicious omelet. (5 stars)

- Good food. Great staff. But need to bring back reservations. The waiting and the sitting is a nightmare. Someone takes names and numbers on phone. A different hostess will take a memory picture of who got there first and big party's will jump ahead because the other hostess doesn't know you where the first. Just need better seating program. (4 stars)

- This was one of the must try places in Philadelphia for breakfast. I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed. I really wanted to like this place, but it fell a little short. First, the wait was long, but we knew that going in. They said it was 45 minutes and that's about as long as we waited. They only have a 5 minute grace period, so if you want to walk around make sure you don't go too far, because if the wait is less and you are more than 5 minutes away, you will lose your table. Our hostess and waiter were great. They were attentive and in a positive mood. They helped us pick out our entrees and offered recommendations.
I was in the mood for fancy coffee. I ended up getting the pumpkin spiced latte which was overfilled and super sweet. There was definitely 20% coffee and 80% cream and sugar. It was super tasty though! You would think the coffee would be enough to curb my sweet tooth, but I really wanted some french toast too. I ordered the cannoli french toast. It was huge! It was packed with cannoli filling and wild berry sauce. The flavor was ok. Way, way too sweet. The cannoli cream was dense. I think more wild berry sauce would have added a tartness cutting the richness.  I was glad I ordered the sausage with it because it added a salty balance to the sweetness. It could easily be split between two or three people. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros. It was recommended by the waiter. He wasn't super impressed with it. It was also huge, but not as flavorful as the description would suggest.
Overall, while they give you huge portions, the flavors fall flat. The coffee was delicious, and the service was great, but the food should be the star and it was just a little disappointing. (3 stars)

- The servers here are so kind. The food was okay nothing crazy. Loved the energy more than anything. (5 stars)

- Updating my review within the same day, because the Sabrina's UCity team did contact me today to refund me my money, and also offered for me to come in again soon, so they can set things right. Thank you John M for reaching out and staying true to your word.  I can appreciate when a business seeks to resolve issues in a timely manner.

Pains me to write this, because I am a lover of Sabrina's through and through. I've been to multiple locations and I generally love their food. Unfortunately, this is more of a customer support issue, and I am not sure who the blame lies with more: Toast, which is the app they use for Online Ordering, or Sabrina's. Since the Toast app literally has no customer service feature and and is the absolute worst, I'm inclined to place the blame there, but I don't really think Sabrina's was helpful.

Long story short, in my haste I ordered breakfast from this location when I wanted to put the order in at the Wynnewood Sabrina's. Seems like something that should be remedied through the Toast app, right? Wrong. There was no way to cancel the order. So I resigned myself to calling this Sabrina's location and having them cancel the order manually. Bright and early I called and was told they couldn't even find the order in the system. So now I'm side-eying Toast. At this point the host remarked that he wasn't even sure how I made an after-hours order. Well I did. And if that's an issue for the restaurant to control, they need to not even offer evening orders for the next day. Anyway, since they couldn't find my order in the system, he stated I should be OK to re-order at Wynnewood. That wasn't really a satisfying answer for me, since my checking account showed a pending charge for the Sabrina's UCity order. Therefore, I was hesitant to be double-charged both at this location and the Wynnewood location. The next host I spoke to allegedly found my order, but said she wasn't sure how to cancel orders. Ugh. So, I gave her some time, and I called back (mind you she said she would call me, but I couldn't trust that). This time I was told my order was finally voided. OK, good.

I order for pick-up at the Wynnewood location. Easy-peasy. Great service and the food was terrific. A day later I find out I was charged for my food at this location! What was the whole confirmation that my order was voided? I was under the impression that I would be refunded. At this point, I'm not even sure what the restaurant is going to do, and I guess I'm just out almost $50. I hardly know what to say, except that Toast is terrible and the Sabrina's employees would do best to learn their online ordering system and how to rectify orders properly.U (5 stars)

- I had no idea that this location was part of Drexel University campus. The top two floors include a lounge area to wait or hang out at, and several rooms for quiet study that any Drexel student can utilize. 

As for the food, the portions are worth the price. My favorite spot to sit is on the lefthand side in the sun room next to the huge window. You can request to sit next to the window by letting the hostess know. (5 stars)

- What a delicious and extravagant brunch! Located right next to Drexel University in a gorgeous historical building, Sabrina is the place to go if you're craving brunch in Philly. I got the peaches and cream french toast, which was a seasonal option. It was decadent and delicious: nothing like fresh fruit and mascarpone. The french toast itself was nice thick challah bread: the perfect french toast bread in my opinion. I also tried one of the build your own omelets. The home fries were super crispy and well seasoned: almost like a thick french fry. The omelet was nicely proportioned and well cooked. The prices were pretty standard for brunch and the service was outstanding. I would definitely recommend if you ever find yourself in the area! (5 stars)

- This was some of the worst service I have ever received. I will not be coming back here. (1 stars)
