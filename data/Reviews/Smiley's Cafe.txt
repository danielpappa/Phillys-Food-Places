- Girlfriend is very indecisive. So smiley said he would make her a half and half of the two she picked. The first time she came here she asked for Almond milk, smiley didn't carry it. So what does the business owner do? He runs out and buys the milk!! Now he keeps it here. 
Just such a great personality.

Reviews:

- Terrible. We ordered chicken shwarma and beef shwarma platters, and they bore no resemblance to shwarma. The meat was just boiled and dry, with no  seasonings and clearly not roasted. (1 stars)
