Title: Le Viet Restaurant

Category: Vietnamese, Restaurants

Tips:

- Garish lighting; great food.
- Pho was outstanding and the other dishes were equally tasty. A little out of the way location wise but well worth the food, the service and the ambiance. Highly recommend this place!
- The jade martini is cucumber overkill. No amount of vodka can salvage this cocktail. You've been warned.
- Very nice interior - now lets see about the food
- Last chance, Le Viet, please be good...
- This is my third time here in one month and the food continues to amaze me. Tried the calimari and crab meat fried rice and they were delightfully tasty. The calimari was perfectly fried, something that many restaurants don't usually get right.
- Happy Hour is from 5-7pm drinks and foods are both awesome
- Pleasant  atmosphere, nice and clean, good service  great food!

- Happy hour Monday - Friday 5pm to 7pm!
- Restaurant week!
- Ask for noodles on the side!
- Service is scattered or inattentive. (Remember to ask for everything you need when a waiter does stop by). Also food comes out poorly times. (Like entrees before appetizers).
- Love that that have weekend lunch specials
- Chicken Wiiiiiiings!
- Absolutely beautiful inside. It takes your local hole in the wall pho place and turns it into an upscale, special occasion restaurant
- Pho is good; does not taste of chemicals.
- #68 sizzling ginger shrimp. Do it.
- If you order a Bun, request for the noodles to be on the side-easier for portion control!
- #6 pop's wings are really tastey!
- If you want to order the pear cucumber drink, confirm Kevin is bartending that evening. The above WAS true, but the other bartenders NOW know how to make it too. But Kevin is the inventor and is just all around awesome!
- Great good and nice atmosphere
- Sizzling short ribs!
- You can't go wrong!
- Very slow service
- Ask for recommendations the staff know the menu
- Ask for #5
- They make excellent old fashions
- Happy hour is until 7!
- No longer byob! Fifteen dollar corkage per bottle!
- The place looks very nice, the staff was helpful, but i can only speak to take out pho. The broth is nothing special (watery, not much flavor). You'll get tastier broth, a better deal ($2 less for pho thai chin) and food at Nam Som.
- Go for lunch: $6 lunch cash only is the best deal you'll find around town
- Sam is an awesome server. Ask him menu recommendations and he'll hook you up.
- Good place to meet an old friend for a chat.
- Watercress salad is a fresh treat....best with beef!
- This is probably gonna be my new favorite spot for Viet food. I am very particular about pho but the pho here taste really good!!! And they have very nice seating inside too. Will definitely come back to try more food!
- Hen xuc banh da is my favorite !!
- Fried soft shell crab
- Lunch is unbelievable!
- Great place to do quick lunch. Love to go here for lunch with my son. :)
- Totally non-descript, but the inside is very trendy and the prices are stellar.
- Great lunch deals on weekdays from 11am to 3pm.
- We're reminded by the server that lunch deals are with CASH only.
- The foods is fresh, the service is great, and the atmosphere is very pleasant.
- I was on my way to Nam Phoung, but it was too crowded with a lot of children, and I just didn't want to wait. So, I found this place on Yelp a block away, and I'm glad I came the food is great! This place is very trendy. It is definitely a date night, after work, or out with adult friends kind of place. You can bring kids, but it is not a family style restaurant. The atmosphere is fun, romantic and business casual. This is a great date restaurant. This is my new spot!

- Food is always fresh. Service is always good.
- Really good prices for lunch time
