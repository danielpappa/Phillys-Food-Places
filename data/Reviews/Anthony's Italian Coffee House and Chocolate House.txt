- I have been a customer of Anthony's for many years.This is why i didn't want to leave a bad review.Today The tiramis√∫ was fantastic as always,but  is the third time that i get a coffee tasting far less than good.I asked for a tripple ristretto and i received a watery,burned,americano-like coffee.I approached the attendant, and she just said "ok"and ignored me.I really like Anthony's, and i believe it is a shame to allow untrained and careless individuals to ruin years of great service and taste.
- So nice!! Delicious gelato and samples. :)
- Good latte had the harvest latte...
- Addictive morning cappuccinos
- Try the chocolate covered popcorn!
- Chocolate covered figs and homemade ginger snap gelato.
- Ignore the menu on yelp because the prices are outdated! The paninis are at least $2 more now.
- Good coffee and savoiadelle was very crispy and top notch!! Would go back again
- Delicious peanut butter hot chocolate... worth a trip.
- There's two white girls drugged up working the counter! Classy.

Reviews:

- Adorable, quaint, an Italian Market gem.

Came here New Year's Day for a mid-afternoon cappuccino and smoothie to-go. Having never visited here before, I was impressed by the amount of drink offerings on the regular menu, plus the addition of holiday beverage specials, like peppermint lattes.

Also did not realize that they're essentially a chocolatier/bakery/panateria and was overwhelmed by the variety of chocolates, candies, pastries, coffee beans and sandwiches jam packed into the tiny establishment. 

Obviously couldn't leave without picking up those dope non-pareil chocolate covered pretzels, but kicking myself for not seeing the pecan turtles in time. 

The outdoor seating area with the awning is a nice touch, but limited and always seems to be filled up no matter the hour, but good to note for future reference when I want a rainy day coffee and sfogliatella.

Prices are very reasonable for the area (and the cappuccino was divine!) Will definitely return. (5 stars)
