Reviews:

- Absolutely love the atmosphere of this place. Sushi is always fresh & tasty. Staff are friendly, courteous & exhibit superb customer service. 10 out of 10 for me. (5 stars)

- We had the most wonderful experience at Bleu!  The sushi is fresh and served with impressive presentation. Absolutely delicious.  I think it was the best miso soup that I have ever had.  In these difficult times, there was loads of very attentive staff and the owner made it a point multiple times to stop by and check on us.  I loved the cool atmosphere and on top of all that,  Bleu is BYOB. (5 stars)
