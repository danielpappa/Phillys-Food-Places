Tips:

- Back again.
- The food was ok but the service was horrible!!! I was eating n a guy was jerking in front if me n they didn't do anything, not even call the cops! The guy I was with talked to that guy the whole time n no one steped in to help us. Knowing we couldn't finish our food, they still made us pay. They didn't even say anything to us until we left. Horrible experience!!! Why would they leave a man sitting there for hours not even ordering food?? Not suspicious????
- Nice clean good price it's right..a must go to restaurant being a date
- Busy today- parking lot is full!
- It's very nice  

They have a shortage of forks though...
- Tri-lingual menu - English, Korean and Chinese
- Nicely decor place and good food. Own parking lot!
- This place is legit on the soft tofu. My husband gets the galbi. Delicious.
- The spicier the better :)
- Awesome tofu soup. One of the best I've ever eaten.
- Mmmmm best soup ever
- Definitely recommend this place! Soft tofu soup is beyond compare!
- Pour the hot water into your burnt rice bowl and eat it, it's delicious something I learned!
- The decor is awesome, feels like  ur in a Kdrama period piece  . Soft tofu soup is what you order here and don't be a whimp , order it as spicy as you can take it in the butt !! Save the BBQ interest for somewhere down the Street . The damn tofu soup is worth any zip code your driving from .
- Really awesome for their soon doo bu (soft tofu) pot, good for one person. Comes either not spicy to very spicy. Comes with a raw egg to be cracked into your bubbly pot upon arrival. BYOB.
- Mushroom soft tofu soup.  It's my heroin.
- Parking lot is full, plenty of seats inside!
- Ask for extra spicy.
- Get the mushroom soon du bu!
- Clam soft tofu
- I love their kimchi!
- Vegetarian options are good for us.
- It's great, like a trip to Korea with Beyonc√© on the radio.
- They have a vegetable tofu soup added to their menu! Score!
- Good side dishes and good soft tofu! Same taste as back in the day!
- No place better for Korean soft tofu between DC and New York, and maybe on the East Coast.

- Surprisingly kid friendly. Hot stone bowls are dangerous but 
1 - in and out in less than an hour
2 - high chair available
3 - tons of other kids
4 - children's potty seat (in the bathroom)
- Seafood soft tofu stew. Good for snow flurry day.
- Love the vegetarian tofu soup options. A bit hard to communicate with the wait staff for us foreigners. We'll keep trying.
- Tofu soup!!!!!
- When you need the waiter/waitress, there's a nifty little bell you can press to have them come over to your table without having to waive them down! Be kind - just press once, and they will have someone over really soon :)
- I love tofu stew! The spicier the better!

- Go with seafood soft tofu soup (with spicy level 3 out of 5). Don't forget to pour hot barley water into emptied stone rice bowl for a "dessert".
- The steamed white rice is the best rice ever ;)
- Super good. Ra raw
- The tofu soups are always good... I used to get the spicy pork RIbs there too... but it was horrid the last 2 times I had it.... dry... and not very much meat.... looks like leftovers...

- Best soondubu in Philly!
- Pickled cucumbers are slammin. Tofu soup and rice in stone pots. Thats what im talking about.
- Been a while but I've been going here for at least 15 years and it's still the best

Reviews:

- I went here year ago and it very good and clean. The location is nice and clean the food always good and fresh (5 stars)

- This place has been a korean restaurant that has been around Philly for many years. I remember I was a child and coming here with my parents. There is much nostalgia associated with this place. 

After a leaving for college and coming back to eat here, I was happy to know not much had changed. The workers great you warmly and the food is served perfectly hot. 

I ordered eel and it was delicious. The sauce and everything. It came with hot rice still in the stone pot which made me feel at home. 

I would recommend this spot if you want somewhere homey and warm. (5 stars)
