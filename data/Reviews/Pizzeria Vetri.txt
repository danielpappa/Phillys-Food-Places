- Please consider sitting across from your friends/bf/gf instead of next to them as a courtesy to others. Don't be that group that sits three on one side of the table and one on the opposite. Space is limited and we all want the pizza to party on our taste buds. Also, live a little and sit next to a stranger and strike up a quick convo! Get to know your neighbors.
- Check in at the restaurant, grab a drink at kite and key, and they will text you when space is available. Get the rotolo.

- Finally tried the arugula salad and it has become a new favorite; I've ordered it on my last two visits!  I would suggest, though, letting your server know how much dressing you prefer on your salad because that part seems to be inconsistent. First time it was lightly dressed and perfect (to me); the second time it was dressed a bit too heavily for my taste (but maybe not for others).

Reviews:

- Pizza is pretty good - thin crust that doesn't totally fall apart when you eat it. We got the margherita, eggplant, and pepperoni pizzas. The eggplant pizza was actually surprisingly good! Would definitely come back if I lived here. (4 stars)

- Right across from our hotel and we were starving after a long day of checking out the city. Reviews were decent so we wanted to try. Ordered the Rotolo (pic looks cool on website), Escarole Caesar, and a large Margarita pie.  Server asked if we wanted anchovies on the salad, and even though my daughter ordered it, I said sure. I love a couple of anchovies on a Caesar salad, so I thought if I snuck a bite, bonus for me. Server came back - no Rotolo.  Ok - so we ordered the breadsticks.  Breadsticks and salad arrived.  Breadsticks - no dipping sauce, kind of a disappointment - pretty good flavor from obviously their dough, but nothing more than Olive Garden really.  Caesar salad - wildly underdressed, so we asked for more dressing.  More dressing added, and completely overloaded with anchovies. Again, I love them, but so anchovy forward that if you like a good Caesar salad, this was nothing like that. It was kind of disgusting.  I am pretty sure that Caesar Salad is not native to Italy.  This should flat out be removed from their menu unless they change the recipe.  Lemon or salt would go miles to help this.  We got the "metro" size pizza as we were hungry; presentation 10/10, price 2/10 (I think it was $28 for a marginally sized flatbread), crust 10/10 (great chew and char), sauce 2/10 (prob San Marzano, but salt and olive oil were nonexistent), cheese 1/10 (almost non existent), and a handful of fresh basil thrown around on the flatbread.  
Service was pretty much as nonexistent as the flavor on the pie - we had to flag someone down if we wanted something.  I wouldn't be inclined to write this review if one person asked how our food was - no one did.  Seemed like a healthy takeout business which is good for them.  However, if you're trying to pick back up, customer service goes a long way.
Service - 1/10
Food  - 3/10
Overall - 3/10
Chance of returning - 0% (2 stars)

- Had a great time at Pizzeria Vetri for a friend birthday   Sesame Heirloom Salad was delicious and obviously the pizza too! Finished the night off with Tiramisu for the birthday girl.  Staff was very friendly, can't wait to go back. (5 stars)

- When did pizza become such a rip-off? For $30 I expected more than a long rectangle of chewy bread, a scant suggestion of sauce less toppings in the center, and a box with the precious Vetri name (even though he no longer owns it). The shape is for sure a clever way to increase the cheaper crust to pricier topping ratio. Really, people, buy a pizza stone and see how easy, cheap & fast it is to make excellent pizza yourself at home. You'll start calling these center city joints a rip-off too. (2 stars)
