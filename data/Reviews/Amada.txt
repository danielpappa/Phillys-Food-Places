- Stay away -  !!!! the entire staff needs to be retrain, seriously

- The most underwhelming "foodie" food I've ever had. Albondigas were edible, but the soft-scrambled eggs with shrimp were salted beyond recognition.
- The sangria here is phenomenal!
- Happy hour menu!
- Located in the Old City area, downtown Philadelphia.
- Oooohhhhh yeeeaaaah!!!! You was poppin' all that good shit a minute ago!!!

- Seasonal sangria is a great start!
- Classy!
- Definitely try the Spanish Tortilla and the Shrimp and Chorizo Flatbread. Yum!
- I'd never fallen in love with a pearl onion... Until now.
- Beautiful decor
- I would never come back to Amada.  We ordered 6 tapas for brunch.  Except for one dish (crab stuffed pepper), which was excellent, everything was unbelievably salty.  Boring dishes (used same sauce in 3 different seafood dishes???) and disappointing service.  The waiter didn't even ask if the food was ok or if we needed anything else.  No wonder this place is empty.
- Good tapas
- Octopus 2 ways & more than I can shake a fork at.
- The most amazing Spanish tapas ever! Yum! :)
- Yay! Lamb chops!
- I love Amada. Never disappoints, always hits it out of the park.
- Everything is Espectacular!!! Que viva Espana carajo;)
- Get the fried vanilla yogurt for dessert!!!
- Overall very good. The Lobster paella was great!
- Amazing Spanish tapas place! Not one thing we tasted was short of excellent!
- You can't go wrong here
- The room in the back is beautiful and more intimate than the front. There's a public parking garage a block away off 2nd that's $4/hr if you can't find on street.
- We sat at the chef' stable. Sit on the right most seats as it provides the best view.
- We just ran in with my two kids, but food was great. My kids also loved it!
- Iron Chef Garces' joint
- Tapas

- As Rachel would say: yummo!
- Ham croquettes are to die for.

Reviews:

- Amada is definitely one of those restaurants that offers both variety and value. I made a reservation for Restaurant week after hearing good things and was not disappointed. The candlelit decor provided charming ambiance while the Spanish style tapas all hit the mark on flavor and presentation. For appetizers, we got the patatas bravas, pimentos de padrons, chorizo pamplona, and aged manchego cheese. The aged manchego cheese definitely proved to be the star of the night: the subtle hint of truffle lavender in the honey paired beautifully with the cheese and set a wonderful precedent for the rest of the night. For entrees, we both settled on the hanger steak (amazing!), paella (just ok), and spanish octopus (another favorite!!). Finally, we ended with their Spanish cheesecake and Catalan xiuxiu (a puff pastry filled with chocolate over apricot jam). Usually I'm not a fan of dessert, but I have to say these hit the spot. The cheesecake had a citrus kick that I loved while the chocolate in xiuxiu was also very yummy without being overbearingly sweet. The service was also extremely prompt and we never found ourselves with an empty plate in front of us! Loved it here and would definitely recommend for a date night :) (5 stars)

- The service was a little slow. Although we had a reservation, we had to wait for a while. Additionally, the waitress took a while to take our order and bring our food. The food was average, the flavor and way it was cooked made me feel like I was being scammed. They had cooked a 20+ dollar small piece of steak to well done and the flavor down to the infused oil was all very basic. The spinach puff also did not have anything special to make it worth it. The only dish truly standing out in flavor was the first, the cauliflower. (3 stars)

- This is my third time at Amada and it trumped the others. The first was good, second not so good, third 15/10 recommend to all friends. Tonight we got espresso martinis at the bar which were DELICIOUS - so flavorful. We also got the albóndigas (always been a favorite), the Serrano ham (delicious, especially with the olive oil added), and last but not least the CHICKEN WINGS were so good we got two orders. The wings literally fall off the bone and the blue cheese crema is DECADENT. They also gave us a free order of the patas bravas which I must say were not good. I've had them before and they've never been good - They're puffy, large cylinders with spicy aioli on top. They were so covered in paprika that they burned on the outside and tasted just like burnt paprika. They're always too "potatoey", though - need more crisp. The first time we went we also got a duck dish which was phenomenal but no longer on the menu. Skip the octopus, it's chewy and over cooked. I think if you know what to order here, you can't go wrong. Overall the vibes were out of this world (I love a dark, quite bar) and the food was all 10/10. Amada really made a comeback with this one, will be back soon. (5 stars)

- Thank you for ruining our NYE.
They sat us by the window in a communite top with half restaurant empty.
Forced a menu without caring about out dietary restrictions.
Waiter was condescending and rude, we had the same plates for 5 corses, no table maintenance, no sharing tools for a menu that it's all shared items.
Food was mediocre to say the best.
To finish, management should know how to take care of guests in case things go wrong, I had to stand up to go look for him.
Once I mentioned that we had a bad experience and that my friends couldn't eat Bz of their dietary restriction, instead of feeding us or making sure that we would leave happy, the manager just took off a pre set menu from the bill (like money was the issue) didn't bring the check, 
Didn't apologize and that is just ridiculous.
My suggestion guys, hospitality is taking care of people not to discount a messed up bill and basically toll their eyes.
I suggest a training for management and foh,
Hospitality is Take care of people period. (1 stars)
