Reviews:

- The staff here was amazing, you didn't feel "waited on" you definitely felt they were invested in your happiness. The appetizers were delicious, the signature cocktails phenomenal, and the dinner was planned perfectly. I left full and happy. (5 stars)

- Probably the best wine pairing I've ever had! The staff was so knowledgeable and welcoming. The momster and I had the loveliest of times celebrating our birthdays here together! (5 stars)

- Philadelphia is lucky to have Vetri Cucina. Five years after my first visit (and over two decades after they first opened their doors), Vetri is still making the best food and providing the warmest, most complete dining experience in the city.

Every impression and feeling from my first visit has only improved. The most recent time I dined at Vetri, my dining partner and I were blown away by the tortellini in seafood brodo (impossibly delicate and yet so flavorful!) and the roasted goat, which was, in the words of my partner, "the single best bite I've ever had." Also, if it's on the menu, get the molten pistachio cake. It's incredible - possibly my favorite dessert ever.

Service is always impeccable and welcoming, from the moment the maître d' greets you to the friendly goodbyes as you walk out the door. A shoutout to Bobby - who described the goat dish so wonderfully, I think it made the dish taste even better - and Zeke, who were and have been memorably wonderful.

We spent over $300 on our meal for two, and it was worth that and more to see every bite bring an expression of wonderment and joy to my dining partner's face. Vetri encapsulates what a special dining experience should be - expertly executed cuisine without the pretention, and an overall experience that leaves diners feeling fuller - both in regards to food and happiness - than when they walked in the door. (5 stars)
