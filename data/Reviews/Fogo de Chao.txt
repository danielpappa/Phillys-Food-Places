Reviews:

- Was in Philadelphia for a conference and some colleagues wanted to eat here; there are a few of these out by where I live but I had never visited before and figured why not. We each got the 'full package' - basically the meat circus and salad bar. To be honest, I didn't even walk over to the salad bar because why would I fill up on greens when the meat is the main event, but I did hear it was good. Overall, the experience was pretty cool - the whole red light green light interaction and seeing the different cuts of meats coming around was fun, a little overwhelming but fun nonetheless. Near the end they didn't seem to come around as much and the waitress kind of forgot about us too, but overall it was a good time and I could see visiting the chain locally. Oh and the bread bites were the best! (4 stars)

- So, went here for me and my boyfriends 1 year anniversary. The atmosphere was beautiful, very inviting. The salad bar was horrible. The food brought to you by waiters was good, the meat was great. But there were no sides....so it was a shitty salad bar with a lot of meat. It was $65 a plate, which honestly I'd rather go to a really fancy restaurant and get a MEAL..not some glorified BBQ. I would suggest replacing the literal potato salad and glazed peanut bar with vegetables, noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, stews. Went for the gimic, won't go back for the food. (3 stars)
