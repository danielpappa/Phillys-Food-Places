Title: Han Dynasty

Category: Chinese, Restaurants

Tips:

- BYOB!
- Hard to find parking, but I can definitely say hunting for a spot will be so worth it. The portions are more than the average. Plus a variety of spicy dishes. Really like this place.
- Cheers to Mark!  He is friendly, personable, and gives honest and prudent menu guidance. He makes the experience much better. Thanks, Mark!
- Mapo Tofu (veggie too!)
- When they say their food is hot, believe them. Best Kung Pao I think I've ever had, though.
- I want to bathe in Dan Dan noodles. That's my happy place.
- Great mixture of spicy and non-spicy food. Its also BYOB.
- FYI: No alcohol on site.
- Dan dan noodles- yay! Happy to have this place in the 'Yunk.
- Even if you think you don't think you like cucumbers get the spicy cucumber appetizer.
- Awesome food. Different locations definitely Cary in their spice levels.
- Advertised as open until 10 but tells us they are closed at 9:40? Don't mind if I do go somewhere else.
- New to the area. Had two takeouts, both absolutely amazing!
- With great friends for my bday dinner!
- Complimentary hot tea. Helps kill the spice a bit. Not much. Just a bit.
- Everything is always fresh and delicious! Come with an appetite!
- Great food and it's BYOB
- Dan Dan noodles, nothing like I've ever had before! Craving it from over here in LA
- Outrageously good Chinese food
- Dan Dan and chili oil addicted
- Must try DAN DAN!
- Ask for Han, let him decide what you eat.
- If you want AUTHENTIC chinese food, than eat here. Best wonton soup ive EVER had.
- After a 6 month hiatus, I'm happy to say the service is more attentive and food is more flavorful [than I can remember.] 

I will say the food prep without gloves in the center table is not appealing though.
- I've tried 5 or 6 entrees; cumin style wins by a mile.
- This is for not boxing something up we told you to box.
- Dumplings in chili oil is pretty good! Love the garlic in the chili oil.
- Order the string beans! You will not be disappointed
- Dan dan noodles are best ever. No one is close.
- My favorite spot!
- BEST CHINESE AROUND! Great lunch specials!!! (Prices average $8) Garlic Style Chicken was stupendous!!!! Food was ordered and arrived at my table in under 10 mins.
- I like it. Open until late and waiters are nice. Food is good.
- Not sure why this is listed as "closed" but in fact it is still open!
- Everything we ate here was delicious. Such good flavors and good service.
- Great food!
- Cold sesame noodles are a must! Don't be deterred by the iffy decor, though I wish they'd spruce it up in here!
- Suburban spicy
If you want real spicy old city or E Mai
- FMucking good!!!!
- Dan Dan Noodles! If you get them for take out, set the container upside down for a few minutes to let that delicious oil soak into all of the noodles.
- Absolutely best authentic food I have had.
- Try the lamb, it's very good!
- They don't like children to come to their restaurant
- Rubber band found in my food and staff didn't care. Didn't even replace dish.
- Tip: If you're Black, don't waste your time. You will be overlooked. Go to the UCity location.. After the socond, "have you been served," and watching other [Caucasian] be seated and have their orders taken (in a reasonable amount of time) before ours is ridiculous.
- Spicy beef noodle soup Sichuan style
- Han is a staple! Cheap, family style meals. The Dan Dan Noodles and Dumplings in chili oil are a "must have"!!! So good and so cheap. Great BYOB on Manyunk!
- Trying out the FOURTH location!! Go Han!!
- Dan Dan & cucumbers!
- How about a tip on what NOT to get. We got the rabbit and peanut appetizer. Do not get it. 
The rabbit is cut through the bone leaving tons of splinters. Impossible to eat. That is not the worst thing. We spent $10 on something we left behind.
- This is the best Chinese Food I have ever had!
- Han says, "it's f'n amazing!"
- Hello old friend.
- Say yes to the Han!
- Ritual de lo habitual.
- The absolute best! Don't hesitate!
- Dan Dan addiction.
- Solo dinner
- Tasting menu tonight!
- Delicious authentic Sichuan food!!
- Food had too much oil in it
Overall ok
But not coming back again
- this is the best Chinese in the area.
- I give it an A for food and a B- for service. No one was in the place at the hour we were there, but our waiter never came back to check on us. The food, again, was excellent!
- Take out order was incorrect.  Food was poor quality.  Will not go again.
- If you like spicy food this place can not be beat. Not an average choice on the entire menu. Make reservations very busy but oh so worth it. Might be phillys best rrestaurant.
- My kidlets like the 'baby adult' options:)
- Great place. One of the only places I actual like to eat in manayunk
- Explore different options on the menu that may not seem so traditional to the American eye.
- Amazing. Best Kung Pao I have ever had. Just perfect.
- Spicy crispy cucumbers keep me coming back
- Great, authentic Szechwan restaurant.  Very spicy.  Great choices on meals.
- I love spicy food. Every time I come to Philly, I gotta come here:)
- Old city Eats- Han offers 3 half priced apps and a $5 drink
- Solid all around.
- If you like spicy food this is your place. Good drinks & good food.
- Never come here without getting the dan dan noodles. Sweet, savory, and warm. So delicious!
- Don't order from here on a holiday  
My husband and I ordered dinner today (Labor day) and the food was terrible.  He had the beef fried rice and the beef was overlooked.  I had the dry pepper chicken and it was too chewy.  In very disapootned considering that we order from here and eat in at least twice a month.
- Free parking nigg
- The food is amazing and the prices are reasonable with a good happy hour!
- Get the dan dan noodles, they're addictive!
- I think the menu prices have gone up a bit so go with the expectation of spending $15-$20 at this place total
- Another great Yelp recommendation. Good was awesome if you like spicy..
- Dan Dan noodles!
- Attn yelpers: free spicy crispy cucumbers after 3 check ins!
- Way above average!
- Spicy cucumbers the past three times have not been crispy and were probably old.
- Love the fish bowl. My friends is obsessed with the dandan noodles here!!!
- Loooove
- Highly recommend the pork belly and dumplings in chili oil apps! Nom nom nom.
- Free parking nights and weekends! Obviously the food is awesome, too.
- Super delicious. If you like spicy, this is the place. Great service.
- Good drinks, but the bar bill can push you to the 1st $100 chinese dinner for 2 you've ever had
- Tasting menu for 8 people was AMAZING. Definitely ask for 0-7 (or the highest spice level you can handle). The 0 ensures you get veggies in the mix. So much food,  so little stomach space. With tax and tip, came out to 25.60.
- You could split one uc dining days meal between two people
- Always an easy call, always just serviceable.
- handy nasty! so delicious.
- Don't go when it's busy... The service sucks! It's sad since the food is great. I'm warning everyone! I've dined here on a slow Sunday and felt like a queen the waiter explained the menu well and was attentive. Then I went for lunch and Happy hour 2 weeks later and WTF... A cluster f***. So if you try this spot look inside, if its crowed go elsewhere unless you have 2 hours to spare.
- Come in a big party so you can order several dishes.
- Spicy cucumber is so good - but eat it quick and try to not have left overs of it - the cucumbers don't stay crisp
- Yes!!! All time fave!
- Get the spicy hot pot for a cold day! Ask for Kung Pao sauce to minimize the spice if it's too hot for the mouth!
- "Due to imminent health hazards observed during this inspection, the establishment was issued a Cease Operations Order and must discontinue food operations immediately. The establishment could not operate for a minimum of 48 hours.Â Inspected June 26."
- Awesome food. Girlfriend and I had an app and entree each. Everything was amazing.
- Dan dan noodles!!! Dry fry beef! Garlic chicken!! Also have another location in olde city. Plus you can giggle at their web page ... Handynasty
- Dan dan noodles guys!!!
- It does have a tv
- Love this place, always satisfied
- Delicious. I would eat the dan dan noodles everyday if I could.
- Ahhh there are enough vegetarian options in the tasting menu to fill up a vegetarian that hasn't eaten all day!!
- Chili oil dumplings vs wontons 
Dumplings sweeter and less bitter
Skin thickness about the same
- Bring at least 8 friends to try the $25, $30, or $35/head tasting menu! The food is served family style and they will sometimes throw in a few off-menu extras, like lobster.
- Dan Dan Noodles... How the Hell is the Pork Belly out by 6?!?!
- Took the tip of others to have the cucumbers, dumplings in chili oil and Dan Dan noodles.  All were good.  Service was slow.
- If ordering Dan Dan noodles to go. Get the sauce on side so it doesn't come soggy and nasty.

Lunch specials are only good from Monday - Friday
- My usual order is the hot sauce style chicken and eggplant on garlic sauce or the dry pepper chicken and the eggplant
- Can't find parking? Look no more, you can park in the parking lot in the back of the building shared with Upenn. Just show your parketing ticket to Han Dynasty and they will reimburse your ticket
- Wait for the new one to open up.
- Great food and service!
- Munchin lunchin omnomnom :-)
- don don noodles = (cold sesame noodles + morsels of roasted pork + siracha) x crack cocaine
- This place is terrible.
- Garlic sauce! Spicy! Yum!
- Try one of the house special
- It was okay. Nothing flavorful about my dry pot chicken.
- Much larger and more spacious than the olde city location. Outdoor seating too!
- Gotta eat family style! (sharing dishes among the group) My friends and I normally get 3 dishes for 4 people. Can ask for rice refills! Definitely makes for a spicy, delicious, and tummy-bursting night
- Much less crowded and better parking than the old city location. Filled the spot of the now defunct mid-atlantic.

- Worst food quality...
- The pepper shrimp is delicious.
- The food was awesome!!
- I am crying tears of joy right now--that is the power of these Asian peppers. I sometimes sit at home alone wondering about the spiciness of organic substances. Now I no longer have to wonder.
- Not as good as the Old City location
- Great food and excellent service. Ordered the Dan Dan Noodles as an appetizer, with the minced pork on the side. Entree was Kung Pao Chicken, which was as flavorful and as spicy as I like it. The waiter was very hands on and entertaining. A 4-star experience for certain.
- The best Asian food I have ever had, zero complaints!!!
- Hands down the best Chinese I've had in my life. Cumin chicken was succulent, spicy and everything.
- Oh, let me count the ways...
- Dumplings & DanDan noodles...wow! Please come to Denver!
- Great food and service. Might want to make reservations.
- Enjoy the appetizer than the main dishes ordered. The environment is a bit noisy.
- Ask for BOREUM (Bo for short) as your waitress. Hands down the BEST service I've had in years. Knowledgeable, funny, and full of great recommendations and anecdotes. Will be back for her service as much as the food!
- Authentic Chinese food. Great vegetarian options.
- Haniversity!!

- Must try the Dan Dan noodles!
- Amazing. So spicy!
- Very tasty Chinese food with good service no reasonable price
- Delicious food. Quick delivery.
- Great food - classic Szechuan food and they have a 0-10 scale of spiciness for the less tolerant - plenty of things to choose from, and entrees come in shareable size portions (2-3) people. Fantastic service too!
- Always delicious! Easy pick up
- The smells of Sichuan cuisine  awaken your senses as you enter the establishment, the atmosphere is very inviting and location is prime if you live in University City.
- The bathroom is absolutely filthy and it's only 4:30.
- Very Gluten Free friendly
- Tried the dry pepper pot chicken, and was not let down. Delicious.
- Fantastic food. Fantastic service.
- Orange plastic chopsticks match the decor!
- Food was good. But the staff was so impolite and impatient. Not a good experience.
- Level 7!
- Could live on nothing but the Dan Dan noodles for the rest of my life. 5 stars.

Reviews:

- Was super disappointed with Han dynasty. I've been to the location in NYC once which I LOVED so was excited to order in Philly. 

Fried Rice- this was completely different from the one in New York. It was very flavorless and there were sooo many chunks of white rice in it. Disappointing.

Kung Pao Chicken- the chicken pieces were very chewy and fatty. At a certain point I was just grossed out and had to stop eating.

Wontons in Chili Oil- it didn't seem like these were in chili oil, they were just in a garlicky sauce and had no spice. The wontons were SO overcooked and fell apart in a bad way. There was barely any meat in these so I honestly don't know if the meat was good or not. I really could not taste the meat.

Overall I'm very dissatisfied and wish I could get a refund for this order. I will be going back to the location in New York because I really did enjoy it but this will be my last time trying it in Philly. (1 stars)

- DO NOT COME here! They have RATS running around in the restaurant.
I came here to Jan 10th 2022 at 7pm. It was shocking to see the rat just running in the seating area. I run without looking back.
Some customers sitting there said they saw it for 20 minutes, and the manager just let it happen. When I left, the manager ( blond hair lady) even tried to explain that the rat was from outside running into their restaurant. It is not a good excuse at all. 
I am seriously concerned about the health and safety of this place. It is a high end restaurant with high cost Food, not the cornerstone so this is unacceptable! (1 stars)
