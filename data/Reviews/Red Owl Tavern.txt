Title: Red Owl Tavern

Category: Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Restaurants

Tips:

- Tasty food and cool atmosphere with great music.  Great brunch with fantastic bacon.
- Hot chocolate on a cold day love it!
- Brian the bartender was the best!!!
- Bruuunch. Ugh
- Watch out for being overcharged on your tab/tips.  Keep your receipts folks.  Apparently this is common practice here.  I've been waiting for an overcharge to be reversed. The manager, Jason, acknowledged that the bartender may have been "confused".
- Great spot for breakfast - especially the prosciutto, arugula and goat cheese omelet!
- Great to sit at Ryan's bar.  He knows how to take care of business.
- Bartenders make a great Makers Mark manhattan. The mussels are ridiculously good. Seriously cooked to perfection. The chef customized to leave out the cream and I ate the entire bowl myself. No regrets.
- Salmon was delish, chicken with creamy grits was lovely. Nice variety of beer and wines. Slow service.
- Yelp says it's not good for kids, but they have a great kid's menu and our kids loved what they ordered off of the regular menu.
- Monday Lobster Clambakes... http://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2016/06/17/red-owl-tavern-lobster-clambake/
- Excellent service and great bartender.  Food average- at least the veggie burger was.  Fries are over the top though!
- This place is awesome...
- Hanging out with Jason, planning to see Sean's mum and Lo as well!
- Loved the food and the customer service!!!
- Excellent scotch, whiskey, bourbon selection.   Great tequilas as well!!!!!
- Margaritas are great!
- Great happy hour
- Great happy hour spot for those who work in Washing Square or Olde City. 2 for 1 appetizers!
- Alan is the man. Goes the extra mile to provide great service! !
- Food wasn't great, way overpriced, waitress complained about a 10% tip
- The vanilla bean mascarpone that comes with the French Toast is to DIE for. I'll be going back for brunch just for that!
- Love the food, it's great taste and quality.
- John or Ryan = top notch service
- "Now through Labor Day, Red Owl Tavern is reviving its New England-style lobster clam bakes. Every Monday, $25 bucks (or $39 the rest of the week) gets you a one-pound steamed lobster all cozied up with some mussels, shrimp, clams, potatoes, and corn on the cob. For an additional $5, you can pair your meal with a New Zealand IPA from Yardley's Vault Brewing Company."
- Exactly my design aesthetic.  I would like to live here please.
- It's small and conveniently located.
- Skip Breakfast!
- Food is good.  There is a lot of rustic unique dishes.  Struggled consistency overall good quality
- Manager is rude.
- Excellent brunch option in Philly
- They have a chef's table downstairs that is excellent for private dining.
- Don't bother
- warning: fresh squeezed OJ is $5
- very nice breakfast. Try the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. It is awesome!
- Pie!! Eat the pie!!!
- Walnut theater subscribers gets free dessert with purchase of entree any day
- Just discovered this little spot. So far the barkeep makes a very good dry Bombay Sapphire martini!

- Checking it out... At Hotel Monaco.
- Delicious burger in a cute tavern setting in Old City
- Great service and really nice bar area
- Omg. The dinner was amazing, the old fashioned (beverage) was flawless and the dessert was phenomenal.
- Red owl was much more fun than stratus.
- Old Fasioneds are a must. So is the filet mignon.
- Food was okay. Seemed overpriced for the food that you get.
- Finally a decent escape from "The Bourse" !  Start with happy hour and finish with dinner
- Went here for dinner.  Staff was super friendly but the food was very subpar.  Had the Red Owl Burger, nothing too spectacular.  I would give it another shot for brunch, but definitely not dinner.
- Excellent service! Pricey drinks, but they're delicious.
- Not my idea of a true Philly experience but good if your staying at the Monaco and need a quick good meal and drink
- Great drinks.!! try the hibiscus smash and the Penn's treaty .!! good service
- Went there for lunch and sat the bar.  Paul, my Bartender was outstanding and the pastrami sandwich with side salad was the best pastrami I ever had. All for 12 bucks.  Def going back!!
