Tips:

- Voila! The Philly Cheese Steak, Local Grass Fed in Brewery Town/Northern Liberties.
My vote for Best in Philadelphia, hands down.
- Local Grass Fed Philly Cheesesteak is still tops.
- Gluten free items identified with a (G) and vegetarian with a (V) on the menu.
- Nice and relaxing atmosphere. Had the berry stuffed French toast with mascarpone. I wish it had actual whole fruits in it. friend had smoked salmon eggs Benedict and was also good. Would recommend this place for a nice brunch. One thing I was disappointed was there lack of coffee selections.
- Brunch was great!
- 18 hour brisket lunch special!
- Still the Duke
- Always packed. Be prepared to wait.
- Best burgers I have ever had!! Crispy and fresh !! Strongly recommend!!
- Scathing review awaits.... Terrible, save your $ and trust yelp!
- Burger is pretty good, but a little messy.
- Unbelievable vegetarian and fresh/healthy options
- Breakfast was generous beyond my appetite.  Delicious smoked salmon egg scramble. Breakfast burrito was stuffed with veggie goodness.
- Much better than 13/Chestnut. Great veg food and Dogfish on tap.
- Quinoa moroccan salmon salad! Delish!
- Seats on the sidewalk or by the windows for watching or joining the parade of green.
- Horrible dont go. Food took an hour to arrive. Well done burger was raw. Never again.
- Last week, I "won" a prize from the sidewalk when I Yelped about Marathon on the way to Suburban Station. I'm hoping that it lasted a week.
- The gazpacho is really good--get some for a super refreshing treat on the warmest dinner days!
- The pitching staff for Irish works on a 4 day rotation. Sunday pm was Spring Training on Walnut Street. The Green Legions are coming out now
- Best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Just the right amount of crisp and fullness.
- Skip it
- Underwhelming Caesar salad, store bought dressing, shitty pregrated parm and croutons aren't homemade either. Suprise
- Still the Duke. Amazing.
- There's a new item on the menu, Local Grass-Fed (in Brewerytown) Philly Cheesesteak--an upstart challenger for Best in Philadelphia.
- A decent, mid-range place with homey plates and friendly staff if on the pricey side. My fave is the Frank's Red Hot chicken sandwich.
- Lots of gluten free options and vegan options!
- Veggie Chili (large) at Last Call
- mmm
- Best chicken salad sandwich I've eaten
- Great trendy but affordable all-around restaurant in Rittenhouse
- Grilled Salmon with Asparagus & Mashed Potatoes exquisitely prepared!
- Come early for lunch before it fills...and fast.
- Fro Yo in a bowl and Iced Coffee, unsweet, are just the ticket at 3 pm.
- Grass fed philly cheese steak and bomb shakes the bomb.
- Happy hour here is the best time to come- great specials.
- Home to the Beermosa!
- bacon not good. smoothies excellent. eggs bene good.
- Excellent salads and smoothies. Plus brunch all day!
- They won't seat you until your whole party is here.
- Still the Duke of. the Realm.
- Loud! Not the place for a business lunch!
- It's okay. Not the best place to eat. I usually go eat when my boyfriend wants to eat there burger. Be ready to order everything at once because its so hard to catch ur waitress after that. I ordered the salad, it was the worst salad I ever had. The chicken had no flavor at all. Milkshakes are good there. But the food takes a long time to come out.
- Good amount of gluten free choices. My quinoa Moroccan salmon salad looks good.
- cheesesteak wontons are a must try in my humble opinion!!!
- Mimosasssss
- The Greek salad with Marathon's delicately breaded calamari is a fantastic lunch treat!
- Very good service for weekend breakfast.
- Skip this place...terrible service!!!! Sat at our table for 15 min, asked the hostess for a server, and watched her tell the hostess, "I get there when I get there"
- Breakfast all day
- Good brunch menu.  Food was hot and fresh.  Good service and a clean dining room.
- In town on business stopped in for breakfast very good quality of food and service
- Salsa is great
- Great day to eat outside. Grilled vegetable salad with calamari.
- Get the Moroccan salmon salad and the french fries.
- Eat the soup
- We've ordered the calamari and the center city sandwich which looks like a good caprese with arugula.  We will see

Reviews:

- I have been there twice and each time was better then the previous. The avocado toast is a must and if lunch is in order get the tomato basil soup. 
Staff is alway friendly and helpful  while the atmosphere warm and inviting. Making the best of these times for a meal  includes a trio to Marathon. (5 stars)

- I've ordered here a few times, specifically this dish as it is my favorite on the menu so far. This is how I picked up my lunch today. It is normally served with the cheese, sour cream, and cilantro on the side so I can add it on my own which I prefer because I don't need much of any of it. Today someone mixed it all together for me and it couldn't look or taste more unappetizing. Why not just be consistent with how the food is served, I won't be able to eat this now! (1 stars)

- sat for 30 minutes without being served on a saturday night. Not sure why this happened but just a heads up! (1 stars)
