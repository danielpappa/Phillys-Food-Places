Reviews:

- We did food pick up and everything tasted really good! The size of the portion were also perfect! (4 stars)

- Came back for happy hour and was not disappointed at all! My friend and I arrived right when happy hour began, which was 3pm and the place was PACKED inside and outside! This place is so popular with really good food/drinks that it will always be busy no matter when you go.

For food we tried the philabundance horseradish cheddar and smoked cheddar sausage. Get the philabundance horseradish cheddar!! The caramelized onion jam was perfection. Nothing was wrong w/the smoked cheddar sausage, but my friend and I agreed we wouldn't order it again. Sausage was good but very small. A lot more bread than sausage. A lot of flavors but I'd skip it and get the Philabundance.

I'll try the fried mozzarella next time because that was what the waitress recommended. Love this place and always have a great time here! (5 stars)
