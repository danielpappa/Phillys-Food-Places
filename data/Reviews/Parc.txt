Way worth it.

- Annoyed right now.  I asked for a larger table because I knew we would be ordering a lot of food and they told me they only give the tables to a party of three or more.  But right next to us they sit a party of two on a larger table.  
Never coming back here again.

Reviews:

- I love this place. So many memories here (5 stars)

- If you're familiar with D.C. restaurants, Parc is essentially the Le Diplomate of Philadelphia.  The chairs, tables, walls, floor, etc. all have been aged to make it seem like an older French restaurant.  I've been to Parc twice and liked all the dishes, including the scallops and the beef bourguignon.  Overall, the restaurant is cozy and the food is delicious (but a little pricey). (5 stars)

- We came early for breakfast, around 9h45am , for an appointment at 10am, it was cold ,
They refused to sit us , it's 10 degrees,
Very disappointing (1 stars)

- I've been coming to Parc for years and it's never lost it's luster. There's a reason why it's one of Philadelphia's top restaurants. The food is always magnificent and the drinks are delicious. The establishment has a cute Parisian feel and I love the location. (5 stars)

- Excellent food, ambiance, and location right at Rittenhouse Park. French cuisine is unique and this place does not disappoint!! (5 stars)

- That's weird. How have I not reviewed this place. Did it disappear? Love all dining hours for this place. Brunch lunch dinner cafe martinis at the bar. Whatever you are craving the atmosphere has it. 
My favorite meals well besides everything is - trout almandine. Beef bourguignon. Steak frites. Beef tartar. Any raw fish crisp or what nots.  Cravings are snails and French onion soup!! (5 stars)

- Came on a date. Service was good, ambience was nice and most of the food was good. However, I am compelled to leave this poor review because of the 20 dollar sardine appetizer. They literally opened a can of sardines, put it on a plate still in the tin and served it. That's it. Not kidding. As my girlfriend noted, it would be no different had they just opened a can of Starkist tuna and served that. Or a can of cat food for that matter. The "chef" should be ashamed of himself. My regret is I didn't send it back immediately. Try Via Locusta next door. They will at least take the pasta out of the box and cook it for you rather than put a box of uncooked Ronzoni on a plate and charge you $20.00 for it. (1 stars)

- Meh-Underwhelmed although my waiter was super attentive and great
Ambiance uninventive cliched and aged getting close to faded ...
Very unclear what the fuss is about  this place to me just a super average french aspiring  bistro you find anywhere ...
First although place totally empty after 3 seating attempts they kept seating me a black solo female diner in the bleachers - busy corridor aisle ,next to drafty window and restock settings,last next to cashier -WHY????
i have read about restaurants treating diners of a certain hue this way but this is first time in my 50 years  I actually experienced ...
Second food meh / started with escargots which were served like a weird soup in a bowl of strange mushroom liquid and mixed with bella mushrooms - hello for $15 you better give me all escargots with loads of butter /garlic /parsley ...
Second course steak frites steak was cooked perfect but frites frozen seeming average...
Star in the meal  was the tarte tatin which is one of the best I have had in a long time... 
drinks pricey but adequate 
overall would not recommend - this is not true french cuisine by any stretch  - have had loads better food in this part of philly and philly in general ...
Maybe they were better on their glory days but looks like the show is long over (2 stars)

- French onion soup is to die for! Service was fantastic. Went here with my family and we all loved it. (5 stars)

- This charming restaurant is on the corner of Rittenhouse Square. I have Parc-ed my butt here so many times- brunch and dinner! The pancakes are a showstopper every time, the table bread is absolutely out of this world, and their coffee is always top notch. There is definitely French feel in this restaurant, but there is an American twist which I don't mind. I love exploring their menu! 

I have gone here post-workout and all dolled up and they seem to roll with anything, which I appreciate. This is my go to for any occasion. (5 stars)

- Bready or not, here I crumb! Omg, the walnut and cranberry bread loaf is second to naan and deserves a spot in the bread hall of fame. It's an amazing juncture of savory, crunch and sweet. A breadtaking delight!

The rest of food is pretty awesome, too. Classically French dishes executed flawlessly. The menu features all the usual culprits: escargot, beef tartare, omelette, onion soup, boeuf bourguignon, Nicoise, etc. The Onion soup was perfection, l sooo rich and robust that it could double up as a sauce. The beef bourguignon was very nice and bursting with bold flavors.

The atmosphere evoques your typical French bistro and it has a lot of old school charm. Service was fine, nothing stood out on either side of the spectrum. Just average service.

The one note is that the bathroom was cruddy and unkept. Some of stalls didn't have toilet paper. (4 stars)

- Overall this place did not impress me. The service was not great, both the hostess and the waitress were not attentive and a little dismissive. The food was also not impressive, the burger was very dry and a little tasteless. The French onion soup was all cheese and no soup. And the escargots were mostly butter and mushroom without actual escargot. (3 stars)

- Perfect. Close your eyes. Open them and you are in a perfect (large) cafe in Paris....

Worth the trip, walking or driving. (4 stars)
