- Don't be fooled by the Chick'n in the menu... It IS NOT CHICKEN duhhh I didn't think of that though this is a vegetarian place
- Quinoa chili, is perfectly crafted, simple, super hearty, and healthy.  Easily one of the best chili's I've ever had, anywhere.

- Get avocado on your burgers!
- Udon Noodle Salad all the way!

- Free green lemonade with 1st check-in on foursquare
- Veggie time
- Crispy Hip City Ranch and Udon Noodle Salad are my faves!
- Geez it's all good but the banana whip is gotta be illegal, get that and a dark chocolate candy bar and you will be in heaven on your couch.
- Best fake meat ever!
- A great place for vegetarians. Order sweet potato chips! Delicious!
- Stupidly, insanely good vegan food. That is all.
- As with most places in the city, HipCityVeg is super small, so if you're getting your food to go, be prepared to be uncomfortably crammed in there.
- Udon noodle salad yum!
- If you're looking for a good burger without leaving with a heavy, regretful feeling then try the Ziggy burger. Still a little on the pricey side for a burger but definitely good size. Have yet to try the sweet potato fries with the black bean dip!
- Interesting, as a lot of the menu is based off of meat dishes (ex. Burgers, Philly Steak, Spinach BLT Salad, etc). I got the crispy ranch sandwich and I couldn't believe it wasn't actual chicken. Great taste, would definitely come again!
- The brownies really rich and chocolatety without all the dairy. Must try!
- The  food here is amazing! My bf and I went here bc they couldn't deliver to the apt so we made the trip over from Girard. Totally worth it. Even my meat lover bf and his family were fooled thinking the hip city ranch burger was too good to be vegan. Excellent service, excellent food. 5 stars in my book.
- Their vanilla ice cream milkshake is ADDICTING!  Need wider straw!
- Definitely try the groothie! So delicious
- Best burger ever!
- mmm groothie... light and tasty perfect for a pre-happy hour snack
- I am a vegan foodie and this was my first time visiting Philadelphia and HipCityVeg. It was phenomenal! I had the udon noodle bowl, sweet potato fries with a creamy cilantro dip and the green lemonade. Hands down, the best vegan restaurant I've visited! We need one of these in Atlanta!
- Buffalo Bella is my favorite but I get it as a wrap
- Seasonal quinoa chili rocks!
- Quinoa chili = yes.
- Unbelievably good Udon Noodle Salad...Try the Groothie.....I will return!!!
- I experienced Hip City Veg for the first time yesterday. The Ziggy Burger was amazing! It's large enough that you don't need fries. The burger alone was $9.
- The Philly Steak is bomb! I'm not even vegetarian and I didn't taste the difference. So much flavor. Must order!
- Udon noodle salad is bomb
- Hope they add Gluten-free breads to the menu! And if the nuggets could become Gluten-free that would be MaGiCaL!
- Best light local organic meal
- Fav vegan place
- add tempeh to the hip city ranch!
- No bathroom?
- Vegan heaven for junk food lovers. Perfect if you want a quick, inexpensive, tasty vegan food.
- This is the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten. And it's not chicken
- The banana whip was perfect!
- Had the curry tofu wrap, very filling! Green Lemonade was refreshing
- call ahead
- Mmmmmmmmmmm, green lemonade...
- Great food all the way around!
First time here but ordered a little bit of ever
- Great food but wish each item was a buck or two lower in price.
- Awesome little place that serves up vegetarian and vegan options in a quick service environment at a reasonable price. Sweet potato fries and the fajita wrap are $$$
- Udon noodle salad = amazing!
- Amazing
- Quick service, but expect no seats!
- It's always hard to find good vegetarian food so I was excited to find this place. Inside is cramped so doesn't make you want to sit and stay to eat. I ordered the fajita wrap to go. It looked nearly as big as Chipotle's but with a wheat wrap. Overall the wrap was good thanks to the avocado and Pico de gallo but I'm not a fan of the fake chicken and I would have like sour cream to moderate the spicy peppers.
- Limited seating, awesome food
- The Groothie is awesome!
- Get the sweet potato fries
- No bathrooms for customers :(
- There's not a lot of seating and there's no public restroom. Price for their vegan philly steak sandwich is about the same as one made with real steak!
- VegNews Magazine recommends the Crispy Hip City Ranch.
- Carrot ginger lemonade is very refreshing,  but doesn't taste like carrots or ginger. Looking forward to trying more on their menu!
- It is really good food, i will recommend to every one to try!!!!
It is healthy.
- Got delivery to work- awesome sweet potatoe fries and the hipcity ranch! Awesome!
- Preshift milkshake.
- Green smoothie = groothie!
- I love this place...delicious, friendly and all compostable packaging...Udon noodle with chic'n and pnut sauce is amazing! Also the chili is yum for a cold healthy winter day...finally a veg cafe that's affordable, quick and worth it for your non-veg friends.
- Wonderful all plant-based menu. Great for lunch!
- Ziggy Burger and Side of Fries are AMAZING!!! Happy vegan right here.
- Favorite restaurant in Philly. Fun, fast, good...Real good. Ziggy and Crispy HipCity Ranch are the strongest points. Groothie, banana whip, pumpkin shake and sweet potato fries are all great choices to compliment your burger. I've also tried the Med Salad and Ranch salad, and while I normally go for greens over buns, I highly encourage the latter for the full experience. I've eaten here 4x / 3wks. It feels good to support this place. (FTR I have no competing interests to disclose.)
- Bomb vegan food! Had burgers and sweet potato fries and the cupcakes
- I love this place!!!
- Always fresh,always delicious and a great friendly staff. Definitely recommend!
- There's not alot of seating so its good for take out
- Vegan vanilla milkshake tastes just like Breyer's icecream, my childhood favorite.
- Banana whip is the perfect healthy treat on a hot summer day!
- Very small seating
- Awesome all-vegan restaurant, especially good for lunch.
- had a veggie burger and sweetie had a fajita .  both were very good
- This place always has a line, but today I walked right up to the cashier and made my order. I kept my order simple: med. salad and sweet potato fries, definitely will come back and explore the menu.
- I totally fux  with the PHILLY STEAK... It made the drive from DC worthwhile.
- Ziggy Burger was great!
- If you're vegan and in need of a smile from plant based satisfaction, come hither!
- This place is great! Just remember... No bathrooms
- There is a person that takes your order while you stand on line. Neat.
- Crispy Hip City Ranch was much better than I expected. Legit!
- Buffalo Bella burger! Enough said
- 1st timer... Tried 4 items and instantly wished I didn't live 2000 miles away. Burger - great! Asian salad - wow! Sweet potato fries - yum! Groothie - delish!  Please pack up and follow me back to AZ.
- Amazing"plant" manager!! Awese service and aaaazing food
- Great spot for some quick, fresh, high quality healthy eating.
- Awesome Chicken Nuggets and Sweet-tator fries!!
- Udon noodle salad is amazing but this place is very pricy
- Good food!
- Wow this place rocks
- One of my favorite places in all of Philly!
- Ridiculously good food
- I LOVE this place and I am not a vegetation. My boyfriend was completely fooled, he had no idea he wasn't eating real chicken! We both got the fajita wrap with the chipotle cream on the side. It was so good we then ordered a crispy hipcity ranch. It was also DELICIOUS.
- Ziggy burger - vegan hamburger with smoked seitan bacon. My meat-loving friend couldn't stop talking about it all night.
- Lots and lots of fake meat, no vegan cheese :(
- The food taste just like meat. The chicken tofu had the texture of chicken
- Delicious! Everything is amazing. Highly recommend.
- Portobello sammich. Will not didappoint.

Reviews:

- I would say location is in Rittenhouse square rather than Penn center but I really enjoy their BFG smoothie or (blended fruits & greens!) healthy and yummy. (4 stars)
