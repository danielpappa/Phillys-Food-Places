Reviews:

- I have frequented interstate drafthouse for the past 2 months. I must say, the tall white fellow who is always reading a book is quite a nuisance, however, i have never had better service from a bartender than i have had from shay. Shay is the best bartender in all of Philadelphia. When they make me a boozy pumpkin spice latte, i shed many a tear. Many a drunken night have been spent enjoying boozy pumpkin spiced lattes from shay at interstate draft house, which i personally call shay's bar. The food is wonderful, however; when i recently ordered a Mexican street corn, i found the sauce to corn ratio rather unsatisfactory. It only happened once. Every other time the corn to sauce ratio was spectacular. I also like the wings, and one order of chicken tenders are enough to feed all three of my bratty kids. If you go to shay's bar, be sure to order a boozy venti iced pumpkin spice latte from shay. You won't be disappointed. Four stars. (4 stars)
