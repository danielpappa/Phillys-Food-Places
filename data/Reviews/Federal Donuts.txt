- Monday October 3rd until Sunday October 9th all Federal Donuts locations are serving a seasonal donut, The Great Pumpkin Roll Fancy Donut ($2.50). $1 from each donut purchase will benefit Fair Food Farmstand, which carries a fresh produce from farms and food producers in southeast Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey and is located at Reading Terminal Market.
The donut is topped with cream cheese icing and toasted pepitas. Its glaze is made from local pumpkins from Lancaster Farm Fresh.

Reviews:

- Fantastic!

This is a review from a donut snob. Seriously. I've eaten a lot of donuts in my travels and most are disappointing. I have a single, favorite donut shop in California, but living on the East Coast now, that's rather moot. 

I saw a review of Federal Donuts a while back and have followed them on Facebook for several years. However, we live about five hours away so it was never really practical to visit. In a stroke of luck, I happened to attend a meeting that took me near Philadelphia, so I decided to drive out of the way and stop by the closest Federal Donuts.

This location is literally a hole in the wall...I would never have known the location was there unless my nav system said it was. Purely a residential neighborhood; I didn't see another business anywhere. I thought it was closed at first, but I parked, knocked on the window, and sure enough - I was in luck! They were open and the rest is history.

Because I wanted to try everything, I ordered a half dozen of their hot and fresh, a half dozen of their fancy, and two chicken sandwiches (I had a couple of my kids with me - I'm not as much of a glutton as I appear! LOL) 

So how were they? We tried the hot and fresh donuts while they were still hot. I have to say - they were really, really good. Unfortunately, I didn't get a photo of their menu, but the donut with the cinnamon sugar coating was the best of the three, even though all of them were great. I really liked the texture, the flavor, the amount of sugar coating. Overall, they were really, really great. Better than any other donut I've had on the East Coast, hands down.

I then went on to try the chicken sandwich. I loved the crunch of the fried batter. I've seen a couple of complaints that the chicken seemed dry; it didn't seem that way to me. My only complaint was that it did seem quite salty - and I'm typically one who likes extra salt! Would I eat another one, absolutely! Would I recommend cutting back on the salt a bit? Yep, I think that would help. I did eat part of the second sandwich and it seemed less salty, so maybe the first one was a bit of a fluke. Still...would I eat another? You bet!

We waited till we got home to try the fancy donuts. The snowball was by far the favorite by both taste and texture. It was a hands-down winner. The rest were really good. The donuts disappeared in this order: snowball, peanut butter cup (that was really good), banana (surprisingly good!), apple pie, blueberry (I liked it; my teenagers didn't as much), and then the chocolate cream one. I think that's the name...it was chocolate coated with a yellow dollop in the middle. The texture was great; the flavor was lacking, in my opinion (my kids liked it though). 

Overall, I really think these are the best donuts on the East Coast. Or at least the best donuts I've had an opportunity to try. The texture is amazing, and for the most part, the flavors are really fantastic. The chicken sandwich was a bit salty for my taste, but I'd definitely eat it again for certain. 

My recommendation: if you haven't tried Federal Donuts, you need to! I most highly recommend them and support them as a non-chain local business too. I really wish they'd open a shop closer to me because I'd be there as a regular (then again...my waistline might not appreciate that...LOL). Anyway, the bottom line is this: I most highly recommend Federal Donuts and if I'm within an hour or two of Philly in the future, I'll make the drive and pick up some! (5 stars)

- Holy Moly, where have u been all of my life ??

Best donuts in N. America... can I actually say that ? Yes I can.  I've tried donuts from Socal to Boston,  nothing can touch these..... (5 stars)
