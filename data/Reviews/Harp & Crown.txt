- Food & Wine's Best New Chef of 2012 Karen Nicholas is heading Harp & Crown's kitchen.
- "In the basement, Elbow Lane, an exclusive downstairs lounge with its own cocktail bar and a two-lane bowling alley. Lanes are available by reservation only -- they're thinking $200 per lane (including bowling shoes), which may seem a bit lofty at first, but consider this: the bowling area is roomy enough for over 10 people per lane. All you need is a big group for a relatively inexpensive bowling experience. Elbow Lane opens at 5:30 p.m., daily."
- Has a waiting lounge if you come early :)
- This review is just for the fact they don't have highchairs!
- "Ending lunch service; last day will be Friday, March 31. Following that, Harp & Crown will open weekdays for happy hour beginning at 4 p.m. and continue with regular evening hours."

Reviews:

- 90% of the food was delicious, so fresh and excellent pairings or vegetables with sauces and flavors. We considered the tasting menu for $50 which is a great value as everything is served tapas style and pretty strong portion sizes. The mushroom Truffle pizza and fig and ricotta are a MUST. perfect blend of flavors. The tuna Carrpaccio was very underwhelming as they tried to put together too many ingredients which complicated the dish. The steak was cooked well and paired with veggies and cookie Skillet for dessert with sparkling candle is a nice rich finisher. The restaurant is spacious try to get a seat in the back of the restaurant not the entrance (4 stars)

- Been there a few times with my girlfriend and has always been a good time. The ambience is what really sells it. The serving size is on the small side but everything is tasty. The bartenders are very talented & Make sure to try the cocktail "Ruby slipper". The only real complaint I have is the lack of mask wearing, even when someone has it on it's always below their nose if not just below their mouth. 

Also make sure to get a reservation several hours earlier to make sure you have a spot. The place gets packed quick. (4 stars)

- I was excited to finally try out Harp & Crown. The place is huge with a large bar a little off to the center of the restaurant. There are couches on the side that you can have food and drinks at too. The place is pretty dark inside too.

We went with the chefs tasting selection menu which includes 8 plates plus dessert for $50 per person. There is option to select your own plates or picked by the chef, which we opted for. 

As for drinks, we got the ruby which was delicious. The first 3 plates came out.
1. Kale salad - it was good, nicely seasoned with a light lemony vinaigrette 
2. Fig ricotta toast - the ricotta on the toast was delicious. I wasn't a fan of the figs, I thought it was a little too sweet. The bread tasted more like wheat bread.
3. Tuna - probably my favorite dish of the night. Thinly pounded tuna which complimented the cracker well with the other ingredients. 

The next 2 dishes came out:
4. Garlic shrimp - the head and tail are still on there but they come out easily. Shrimp was well cooked but I had no idea it was flavored with garlic until I read the description after
5. Mushroom truffle pizza - soft thin crust. Flavors were good

The last 3 dishes:
6. Tomato rigatoni pasta - probably the most disappointing dish of the night. Quite bland with over cooked pasta. There is a small spoon full of sun-dried tomatoes which helped add to the flavor profile 
7. Crispy Brussels sprouts - pretty good but nothing to rave about. Crunch is from the fried onions on top
8. Hanger steak - well cooked, good dish

Finally we ended with the selected dessert. I wish we chose the dessert but we were surprised with rice pudding. It was okay. The jam made it stand out a little.

Overall, food was average. I was surprised by the quantity of the food- they were large portion sizes and we had a good amount leftover. Quantity wise, we got more than what we paid for. Timing of the dishes were great as we were not overwhelmed with all the dishes at once. Ambience was great. (3 stars)
