- Great corned beef and hot brisket
- You want to go to here and get one of their crazy sandwich combos.
- Order ahead!
- If you are hungry, inpatient, and especially if you are hungry and impatient this is NOT the place for you. It took about 45 minutes from the time I walked in until I got my sandwich. My sandwich was excellent but I swam laps this morning and then walked the 2.5 miles from Rittenhouse so I wasn't that stoked to have to wait so long.
- Impressive Covid-19 Policy regarding ordering, picking up and delivering of the finished products to the customers at the door.  Awesome!!!!!
- Appppp
- Worst service to busy fighting amongst themselves. Called ahead 20 min did not start order till we arrived.
- Call ahead, it can get really busy at lunch time.
- Call ahead to order! Takes a while for the sandwiches to be made
- Love my smoked turkey sandwich!!!
- Another double listing that needs to be taken down.
- One of the best sandwiches ever had
- Not a sit down place and a long wait but free samples while you eat!!! So nice :)
- Great! Great! It's has a mom and pop vibe! Sandwiches are delicious.
- Best hoagies in town! Their food awards are well earned
- What's better than free samples of other meats while you wait?! Come hungry!!!!
- Jarred's favorite!!
- Been coming here since I was a freshman at Penn, everything good but my fave sandwich is Drexel Special which I get hot.
- 27 minutes for a sandwich...
- Don't be shy; order in. Koch's loves characters.
- This place is legit in every way, shape and form. Just eat it. Enough said.
- Best place to order from while at work. However, their delivery time is HORRIBLE
- Nothing spectacular - expensive won't make a special trip to go back.

The corn beef was at the end and not really fresh, cole slaw and Russian dressing ok.

Pickle and rye bread was good.
- Almost 2 hours has gone by and we are still waiting for our delivery. Don't order if you have a scheduled lunch break.
- Huge amount of meat and delicious! Fresh!
- The business is nothing like when the original owners had it!

Reviews:

- Sandwiches are smaller than I expected, but excellent.  Someone else said their Pastrami is god's sandwich, but I'd designate the Penn Special for that. (5 stars)
