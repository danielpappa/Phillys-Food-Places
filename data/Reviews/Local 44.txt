- Dog food-like seitan nuggets. Sour, one-note seitan Reuben. Have been disappointed by the veg food for years but after last night, will definitely never be back.
- Get avocado on your burger.
- Brussel sprouts are the best
- Can't go wrong with the Happy Hour: $3 all regional drafts (think Troeg's, Victory, Dogfish Head, etc) 5-7pm
- Gluten conscious! No dedicated fryer tho so if it's deep fried you'll have to skip it 4 now if you're gf. They have a gluten free beer
- Old friend. Bring me the chicken and biscuits!
- The audacity of them to think I'd put this bumper sticker on my car after the crappy food and service

- December 26 through January 1, they'll be running all local drafts, menu specials, starting happy hour early (which means $3 beers and a menu of $3 and $4 snacks) and a special New Year's Day brunch served all day, from noon to 10pm, on Sunday, January 1.
- The new gnocchi is great! Also, I would come here just for the beer and popcorn.
- Lunchtime M-F is crowdless & pleasant.

- Beer-Mosas!
- BRING ID
- Try the seitan  buffalo nuggets. SO good.
