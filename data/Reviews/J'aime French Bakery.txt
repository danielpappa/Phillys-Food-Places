Reviews:

- I'm so thrilled to discover this wonderful French  pastry!!!! As a dessert lover, I'm craving for a delicate pastry shop in Philly (where it is hard to find except the Korean Paris Baguette...). I'm soooooooo glad to discover this little place! The croissants are both crispy and soft at the same time. You can taste the delicate thoughts put into these bakery. Definitely will come more often!! (5 stars)

- Super awesome and cute little shop. I appreciate they checked vaccinated status. The staff was extremely attentive and nice. They helped me pick out the right pastries for me. Would recommend and going back (4 stars)
