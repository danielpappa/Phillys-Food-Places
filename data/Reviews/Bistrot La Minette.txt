Reviews:

- My friend and I came here for Center city restaurant week! 
We love french food and were excited to try this place based on the great reviews. 
When we first walked in we were greater by the staff. They offered coat check and we were seated right away. They gave us complementary cheese puffs and french bread with delicious house made butter. For appetizers we got the foie gras (first time trying) + escargots. Foie gras was definitely an acquired tasted. It was good but a bit too salty for my taste. The escargots were delicious and buttery. 

For entrees we got the mustard brazed rabbit and coq au vin! Both were good portions of food. Both were super delicious in their own way. 

Dessert we got the creme brulee and raspberry puffs. The creme brulee was creamy and delicious however the top sugar portion was alittle burnt for me. The puff pastry was very delicious. Overall food, service and experience was top notch! Would love to come back again next time I'm craving french food :) (5 stars)

- Came here for January 2022 Restaurant Week. Very cute date night vibes and meeting you with friends. Our waitress Nicole was so patient and great with providing recommendations! Would definitely recommend the escargot and mustard braised rabbit! (4 stars)

- Went during restraint week and wish chose otherwise.  Food was cold, waiting staff was below average and prices ridiculous. (2 stars)

- Restaurant week 2022 experience!! 

Ambience is very dim and calm inside, can see into the kitchen, nice little setup. 

Menu had a good amount of options in terms of variety. Something for everyone imo no major beef dish though. Chicken pork fish and rabbit were options for restaurant week (full menu probably had a beef option but I didn't look)

To start. My wife got the escargot and I got the foie gras. Both did the trick and Are recommended. The house bread and butter was a hit as well. 

For main course I got the rabbit pasta dish. I was worried that the rabbit might be too gamey but it honestly could've passed for chicken. Well put together dish but for new rabbit eaters be careful of tiny bones 

My wife got coq au vin which had potatoes mushrooms and pork belly and I don't think you can go wrong with that dish. 

Desserts were the star of the show. Mille feuilles pastry was a show stopper and the crème brûlée was top tier as well. Recommend both. 

Restaurant week was 40 for 3 courses. Solid portions for the money. 4 stars!!! (4 stars)
