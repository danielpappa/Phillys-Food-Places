Tips:

- The cornbread...is...amazing.
- No more Sunday Happy Hour = sadness.
- Saut√©ed carrots, duck nuggets, poached pears. 

Enough said.
- Awesome happy hour specials
- Great design and decor, but the menu lacks an identity.  The food and it's preparation need some tweaking.  It's still a fairly new place.

- The Juke Joint.
- Found a bug in my food! Gross place!!!! Don't ever go!
- Actually never mind - never got drinks after 25 mins of waiting
- Best place in this small South Street area. Bourbon lovers reunite.
- Try the infusion cocktails! The service is slow on a Saturday night, but only because it's busy. The server was friendly and attentive and he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, but he always made us feel like we were his first priority when he was with us. Great food! Great music upstairs! Would recommend again and again!
- Ask for the special dessert donut with bourbon sauce and chocolate love. It's a treat they don't have on the menu.

Reviews:

- Went to the Twisted Tail for restaurant week which turned out to be a pretty good choice. The restaurant has a southern rustic feel and they really keep the theme going throughout. The menu had lit choices but the cocktail menu was a bit one note. Just a bunch of different ways to have a old fashioned. I can't lie I loved their spiked hot cider though. The food was just okay. Although good options, all of my food was bland. 
I'd definitely come back and recommend folks to enjoy the happy hour and the ambiance. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing dinner. (3 stars)

- Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was great. There's so much on the menu I can't wait to come back and try. I hope they bring dinner in the dark back! I'm sad I missed it. This is the perfect place for foodies (4 stars)
