Tips:

- Late dinner with my kids.
- Lousy wine but that's not why we are here
- I'm guessing this isn't a great place for vegetarians or even veggie dishes.  The portions are large, but the tofu greasy and missing a lot of flavor it seems.  A packed ambience and obviously popular but I'm unlikely to go back.  Even the spring rolls were a deep fried greasy mess - shouldn't be.
- Roti canai-- you won't regret it!
- Best Pad Thai and at the best price in Chinatown.
- Overpriced "Thai" food. You pay for the "decor".
- awful service.
- Get the Indian pancake!
- Noodles galore
- My second home. Malaysia food
- Dont forget ABC ice for dessert ;)
- Mmmmmmmm, crispy pig anus.
- Roti canai, nasi lemak, and peanut pancake for dessert. Love the meat, hate the bones.
- We ordered the Mee Siam beef, beef satay, abc drink, pancake, fried tofu. Amazing!!!
- Penang Lobster
- Order the roti! I can't stress this enough

- Crowded but the food is so worth it!
- Chicken Satay with Peanut sauce! Try asking for extra peanut sauce- you're going to use it generously!

- First visit, solid 3 star place so far. Get the roti canai for sure (5 stars for that). The char kuay teow was just ok (missing blood cockles/clams). The rendang tasted like it was made with pre-made rendang packet seasoning/sauce.

Reviews:

- I can never go wrong with Penang.
Roti for the table and I usually get curried chicken with onions with rice or beef rendang.

It is clear the plate good. Portions are plenty for the curried chicken but bit more beef can be added for the beef rendang.
Plenty of rice comes with both. Pricing isn't too bad.

Others enjoyed the nesi lemak or hainanese chicken.
Those 4 dishes are usually what's popular for single orders when I go with my friends.

The food can sometimes come slow or fast. It's just hit or miss on that. (4 stars)

- Really excellent, what a terrific dinner. We came in on a whim, and the staff were super friendly, the service was speedy and impeccable, and the food was delicious. The short ribs were outstanding, the satay was very good, and the chicken chow fun was ridiculously tasty. Great place, amazing food, good prices, great staff!! (5 stars)
