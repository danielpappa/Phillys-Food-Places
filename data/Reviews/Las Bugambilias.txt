Reviews:

- As we walked the streets oh Philadelphia we got a bit hungry and came across this spot. It was apple lunch time so we did not want a big meal so instead I ordered the chicken quesadillas and my girlfriend had the chicken nachos. The chicken quesadillas were delicious. The tortilla was perfectly charred and the cheese and chicken was absolutely delicious. My girlfriends nachos were just as flavorful and top our surprise the nachos were perfectly crisp. No soggy chips at all, even the ones in the bottom covered by all the greasy stuff. The service was quick and attentive. We loved the place. (5 stars)
