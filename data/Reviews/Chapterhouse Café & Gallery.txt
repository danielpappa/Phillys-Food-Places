Reviews:

- Iced tea soda was something new to me. I got the orange nectar (rooibus tea and orange) and really enjoyed it. 

The tomato mozzarella sandwich was good too. Maybe heat it a little longer since the middle was still a bit cool. The bread was might and warm though.

Friendliest and liveliest service. Love it! 

The front and back seating areas has more natural light. I'll check out those sitting shots next time. This time, I was on the couch in the middle room. The room echoed a bit so it could be distracting hearing conversations all around. The couch was comfy though! (4 stars)

- I love coming to this coffee shop! It's just a block away from S***bucks, and for one more block of walking how could I not prefer this place?? The baristas are very kind and there are plenty of places to sit and work inside under all of the art they have displayed. Plus, there's Franklin ice cream! I'm looking forward to taking advantage of that more when the weather gets warmer. (5 stars)

- The coffee and hot chocolate are both amazing! The croissants, doughnuts, and pastries are really good as well. The staff took time to explain all the options. Also, the seating area is SO spacious! (5 stars)
