Tips:

- Looked at their menu online after seeing "all vegan" in the reviews and found there's plenty of dairy in the dishes. Vegetarian* is more like it.
- I confirmed with the server that everything is vegan here, including drinks with "dairy" (soy).
- X
- Very good. I usually go to vedge. We will be back.
- To make this expensive treat a little less expensive, two people can split four or five dishes and feel pretty full. The $6 and $7 plates give you just as much food as the $8 or $10 plates. Everything is fantastic, so you can't go wrong with your order.
- 4 thumbs up ;-). That's a fig, on my house interpretation of a booze forward Manhattan.  Groovy.
- I'm vegan but was very underwhelmed. SO hungry upon leaving and after spending $100. I'm snacking as I write!
- Super cute inside and the drinks & artichoke frites were great!
- 5 stars for the drinks
- Great atmosphere and service.
- The food is phenomenal!
- Great place, cool ambience, decent good but a bit pretentious for my taste.

- Maryland crab cakes. They are vegan like everything else at this restaurant. Do not miss them.
- @Charlie's- you need to add a phone number to your yelp page!
- Yummy cocktails and there are also mocktail options. All fresh!
- Cool vibe, except for the prostitute making her way through the bar.

- Lovely place with excellent service but the food could use some refinement (coming from a longtime vegan).

Reviews:

- Came here on a first date and unfortunately both were only okay. I suspect we're here for the food not the date, so focusing on that: smaller portions though they do pitch themselves as a small plates style space. We got I think 4 or 5 small plates for the two of us, plus two cocktails, rounding out to about $40 each (inc tip). Of note: if you get the ricotta, get extra bread (it's free!). 

I suspect if I were vegan this place would be a lifesaver for going out. As a non-vegan, it's a fun place to eat but not the tippy top of my list. (4 stars)

- DO NOT go here!!! The management and front desk treated me terrible arguing with me saying I have a fake vaccination card when I even had emails showing confirmation of my appointments when I proved they were wrong then they switched to "oh you haven't even been vaccinated long enough to come in" when they were just being straight up racist towards my partner! fuck this place and fuck their staff when I know people who have actual fake cards and have been let in do not support this shitty racist business (1 stars)

- I have been wanting to go here for so long. I made reservations and had one of the best nights out! We got a variety of cocktails and tapa style food. The cocktails were all 10/10. We ordered the lyonnaise potatoes, the Korean style tofu, banh mi, and the stand out for me was the "Our Ricotta". I am not vegan and let me tell you this Ricotta was a showstopper.

 I am not a huge dessert-bev girl but let me tell you we got a complimentary "Done & Dusted" might have ended up being my favorite item we ordered. Overall great experience!! (5 stars)
