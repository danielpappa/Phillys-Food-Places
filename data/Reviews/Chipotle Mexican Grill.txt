Category: Mexican, Restaurants, Fast Food

Tips:

- Salad dressing can also be a sauce for your tacos. Yumm
- Now offering brown rice! Woohoo!
- I like the bowl: less calories. :-)
- Out of chicken and steak
- Love the veggie burrito with black beans and brown rice. It's my dinner (and lunch) at least 2x a week!
- Its never to early for a burrito!
- They know how to handle a lunch rush!!
- This place really needs to learn how to have decent looking peppers/onions for your burrito. They usually look dark and disgusting.
- Very friendly staff and good was good.
- Empty on a rainy night
- This my spot love Chipotle over Qdoba any day !
- Lines are long during rush hours but move super quick. What's not to like about chipotle?
- When there's a long line, look at the menu and think about what you will be ordering. Do not hold up the line.  Please don't be on your cell as you are ordering, it is very rude to the servers and to the people behind you.
- They don't have wifi but Targets free wifi usually reaches over!
- Gets crowded but line moves fast. They have quesadillas although they aren't on the menu.
- If you order vegetarian, the guac is free!!!
- Soooooo loud!
- This is the dirtiest Chipotle I've been too!  Just beware!
- Friendly service.
- What do you mean you can't stir my burrito?
- Bad day for chipotle
- This place is a god damn dumpster fire.
- Tasty veggie burrito filled with protein
- Out of tomatoes tonight! Always something.
- Most poorly managed establishment I've ever patronized.
- Get the burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side. You can fit way more in the bowl than in the tortilla.
- Healthier lunch today...
- Love my veggie burrito! Quick fresh meal!
- It's really loud and busy at lunch time
- When I order my food online, I want my food faster than the people who stand in line. Instead I'm forced to watch my burrito get cold. Goddam ridiculous
- Did you know you can mix your meats!? All the meats in one burrito. Majestic.
- Expect them to have ran out of at least 2-3 things if you get there after 8:30pm. -_-
- Whewwwwwwwww the ghetto. Waited over an hour for my food. Never ever again.
- The food not so much but it is good test . No enough place to sit
- Great spot for college kids, right next to PhilaU.
- Next door to the Crown Plaza.
- wear warm clothes in the winter. the door opens so frequently from people walking in, that the dinning room is cold!
- Poorly maintained, messy and loud this chipotle location needs some work
- try everything!
- The manager failed to ask two customers to control their wild kids who were running laps around the eating area screaming at top volume disturbing all the patrons. Finally, I had to get up and say something to them and to the kids. All the patrons applauded.

Reviews:

- This chipotle is atrocious. Cant get a single online order correct ever.
Not only that, the fountain drinks have been empty for months - reminds me of the classic McDonalds "ice cream machine is broken" (1 stars)

- This place is ATROCIOUS. I had a group order for people placed 8 hours before the pickup time. I was told that the location was closed as they finished making our food, and that there were zero chips or guac or queso left for us even though the order was placed FAR in advance. What's worse, almost none of the orders were correct! Chicken was replaced with barbacoa, an entire burrito was JUST rice, and countless other errors occurred. A terrible Chipotle, one that should not be trusted for anything but the most simple orders. Will be looking for a refund and will not ever go back  again. (1 stars)
