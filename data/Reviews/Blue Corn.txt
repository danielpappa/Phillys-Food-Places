Reviews:

- I made reservations for New Year's Eve with no problem.

As usual, service was great. We had ceviche special of the day served with slices of fried plantains chips. It's a perfect appetizer. Not overly salty and not overly acidic either. Subtle hint of lemon was enough to make it not fishy.

My husband had tuna and I had surf and turf. My steak and lobster were perfectly cooked. It's served with potatoes and some greens. Great flavor.

Pi√±a colada is highly recommended, not too sweet.

At the end, when they presented the bill, they gave each of us a NY hat, tiara, beads, and horns. It's very nice of them (5 stars)
