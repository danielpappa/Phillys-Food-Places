Reviews:

- If we learned anything it was definitely give second chances (and totally dine in versus take out). 
We had the most wonderful date night here. Surprisingly busy on a Tuesday, busy overall great experience. Expect some heat in most dishes as is normal for Levantine region cuisine. 
Highly recommend-
Sumac spiced French fries (some of THE best fries in the city..yes I said that)
Arnabeet Mekle (crispy cauliflower with pickled vegetables..great balance)
Kastaleta (two large lamb chops with a good amount of vegetables)
Samke harra (grilled branzino in this amazing sauce, just wish there were more vegetables a part of this dish)

Can't wait to go back! (5 stars)

- My wife and I went here for our anniversary. We got lucky because the weather was awful, so there were few tables available. We decided to sit at the chef's table, so we can enjoy watching the hustle and bustle of the kitchen. Inside was an intimate setting. I recommend get the spice fries and the lebna. They were a new flavor, style that i haven't had, and it was delicious. You can order whatever you want and it will be delicious. We decided to stick with the sides because we wanted to try all the different dips with the pita. (5 stars)

- We went for the prefix brunch this morning for $37pp. The things that came with the brunch are a plate of dips to share and you each get an entree. Our total bill came to over $100 for 2 because we each got a pastry (thinking it was part of the prefixed brunch based on how the menu was set up) and a drink (which was clearly not included. The drinks and pastries were absolutely the best part of our meal which is ironic because they weren't included in the brunch. The cruller was my favorite thing we had along with the chai tea latte. This menu is definitely a very lunch heavy brunch menu there were 3 options that we considered to be breakfast foods (like with eggs). The dip plate was really good also and had decent size portions for two people. I had lamb kebabs for my entrée and they were delicious, even though I did order the beef kebabs lol. My boyfriend had the Ful Mudammas and really didn't like it. The service was OK the waitress was a little bit weird towards us throughout our meal. I would go back to get the pastries and tea and coffee but most likely won't be back for the prefixed brunch. (3 stars)

- Suraya Weekend Brunch  
* must pay $37/pp for tasting menu

We made a reservation for 10am because we tried to avoid crowds esp on the weekend. Went in and there was about 2 other parties, which was perfect. 

The Tasting Menu:
Before the entrees, they will bring out as default the following 
-hummus 
-baba ganoush
-labneh
-muhammara
-taboulé

naan (flatbread) to go with it! i was so in love with almost all 5 and def got a little full from naan. Dont go too hard on the naan because you need to leave some room for your entree.

Entree:
-Shish Taouk (Chicken w/Yogurt)
-Kafta Kebab (Ground Beef Kebab) 

The kafta kebab has cumin seasoning but was hard to taste that due to the meaty taste.

On the other hand, the shish taouk was perfectly balanced 

P.S.
Their latte/ oat milk was really good (5 stars)

- One word - INCREDIBLE
Highly recommend doing the Taste of Suraya menu. Well worth every dollar! (5 stars)

- The place is very nice, I like the vibes.

Started with the baba ganoush, fattouch and arnabeet mekle.
Baba ganoush was good, the pita bread was the highlight lol
Fattouch was fine, enough acid to put the taste of some of the rich dishes.
My favorite was the arnabeet mekle, well seasoned and executed.

The kawarma was good, a little too rich. I wish i saved some of the fattouch to help cut the richness of it. It's a bit heavy, I suggest to pair it with the fattouch.

The prawns weren't mine but they were good, make sure you suck the head! thats were all the flavor is at, eat it with the rice. If you like lemon squeeze it all over the prawns and suck the head lol

Overall it was good, I can say I expected a lot more but it was a pleasant experience still
Service was good, and attentive. They were ready to answer any questions and make suggestions

Come try it for yourself, they're doing something right to have high reviews.

The mezcal cocktail was fire (4 stars)

- The restaurant itself is very nice with dim lighting and nice decorations. The food was rather expensive so we were expecting amazing. Unfortunately, it more than fell short. My friend's brother and I ordered roasted lamb and they both were flavorless, dry, and tasted like charcoal! Seriously bad!  We never complained about the food because we were hungry and didn't have time to wait. My food was nothing to write home about and although our server was very nice and my eggplant old-fashioned was good too, not enough to warrant the food prices. Needless to say, I will not be returning and if anyone is willing to pay $35 for a burnt lamb please come to my house because I can make them the way they should be. (2 stars)

- A great spot in Philly! Loved the food and ambiance of the restaurant. The service was great and we loved the open kitchen. Interesting to see the food being made. We ordered the tasting menu and everything was delicious. The lamb chops were the stand out item. I would definitely go back and try other menu items! (5 stars)

- This place was on my list to try for the longest time, and it turned out to be well worth the hype! I had avoided going for dinner on a Friday or Saturday because you are required to get the $70/guest prix fixe option on those nights. I went on a Sunday night for the option of ordering everything a la carte, which worked well for me because the one vegetarian entree (grilled mushrooms) did not appeal to me. Instead, I ordered an extensive array of mezza plates which was 100% the right way to go. The bags of warm pita just kept appearing on our table and we just kept eating them. The most memorable dish was the fatteh, a warm plate of chickpeas, eggplant, crispy pita, tehina yogurt, toasted nuts, and fresh mint. WOW, it was delicious. All the different flavors and textures came together like a symphony in your mouth. The next best dish was the arnabeet mekle (perfectly seasoned crispy roasted cauliflower). We demolished that one. We also ordered the hummus and the baba ganoush that were both very good but did not exceed expectations. The turmeric rice was good although the portion was a little skimpy. My friends also spoke really highly of the yakneh (seafood stew) and the kafta kebab (ground beef). They also have a fun and interesting cocktail list! I started with "the throne of beauty" as recommended by our waiter, which was boozy and tasty, with mezcal and pineapple. The even more intriguing cocktail was "the poet" with gin, cucumber, aquafaba, and a sprinkling of za'atar. Overall, we had a really lovely time at Suraya. It's not somewhere you would go everyday because of the prices, but I think the quality is well worth the price. We ended up spending $70 per person (including tax and tip) for all the food we wanted (possibly too much? haha) plus one cocktail each. I'd especially love to return for brunch sometime so I can try the Lebanese chai that others on here have raved about. (5 stars)

- By far the best restaurant experience i've ever had. The service was impeccable and the food was thoughtfully made and delivered. Shoutout to our server Richard, who took the time to get to know our table of 10 and really made us feel special. Every single dish delivered was  enthusiastically and thoughtfully explained and i truly have never had a better experience restaurant wise  in my life. Great vibes and great food. Would recommended over and over again. PS richard if you see this, the MD crew is shouting you out !!!! (5 stars)

- My favorite restaurant! The food is incredible and the servers were helpful in describing the dishes. Would recommend to everyone! (5 stars)
