Tips:

- Expensive but good pizza.  You have to order in advance.
- Plain and simple. Get the original pie. Wait get 2. You can eat a whole yourself.  It's that damn good.

- The greatest pizza in Richmond/Kensington
- Good pies.
- the best pizza!
- Simply the BEST PIZZA on the east coast it's also a BYOB
- Wednesday nights you can walk right in.
- Ignore the pansies who whine about the "burnt" crust. This ain't Dominos
- Reserve your dough ... ie you need to make a reservation. Its not that complicated.
- When it comes to toppings, less is more at Tacconelli's!

- Ridiculously good 'za.
- Supposedly best pizza in Philly.
- Tomato pie is off the chain!
- Made it today after wanting to go for 15 years. It's a fantastic pizza sold by super friendly people. Very thin and crispy crust, perfect sauce and great toppings make for the perfect pie. It won't take 15 more years to get back!
- favorite pizza since i was a child. white w tomato and garlic is #1.
- Silly that you need to call ahead even when they are empty, but do it - the pizza really is great ($16.75 for a pie with pepperoni).
- Takeout pies will be half cooked for you to finish cooking at home so theyre hot and not overcooked when you get there. Specify if you want your take out cooked fully when you order it.
- Closed today!

Reviews:

- Tacconelli's has one of the best thin crust pizzas. I grew up in New Haven CT eating Frank Pepe's and Tacconelli's is pretty similar! I must say though, the pizza tastes better when you dine in and eat it right after it's served. 

The menu is really simple. There is selection of toppings with your choice of red or white pie. You MUST call in ahead of time to reserve your pie. 

We got spinach tomato white pie and pepperoni red pie. It was a really good combination because the spinach tomato balanced the saltiness of the pepperoni. (5 stars)
