Long lines - come been 11:00 - 11:15 to avoid

Chef Konstadinos incoherently rambles often so just smile and nod at everything he says

Cash only
- Just eat whatever he gives you.
- Come early and be prepared to wait!
- 9/25 noon time, omg where is he???!
- As of 10/26/15, he's still open! And he had a $5 special.
- Amazing food
- FYI. He was on 20th and Ludlow 2 weeks ago because of the construction!
- First time here. High quality food. So yummy. Will come back again.
- He's back!
- Christos has the best truck
- Food was incredible, def worth the wait!
- Wish I could give 6 stars. Well worth the wait!
- $10. No menu. One platter, that changes daily. Line is long, but worth the wait. If you don't like garlicy or spicy foods, go somewhere else.
- Here for me bi annual pilgrimage.
- Sucks waiting. But generally worth it
- Smile and nod; do not attempt to order more than one platter if other person is not in line with you; vegetarian or regular...those are your choices.  Smile some more and you'll come away unscathed and full.
- Line is long so be prepared to wait atleast 15 mins for sure!!
- Portions downsized
- The best chicken the best food but where is he located now I can't find him...!
- Tried it for the first time today. Best food in Philly by far. It's that damn good.
- Be prepared to wait in line. It takes a while. Don't ask for a menu. He doesn't have one. You get what he gives you for $10. It's usually chicken with sides. If you're a vegetarian, he'll give you falafels as your protein.
- Fresh, spicy and delicious. Well worth the wait. Flavorful and exotic.
- This guy is a real jerk...don't dare ask a question about the offerings unless you want a loud obnoxious rant.  Food is just average.
- Nice place ..worth waiting
- He has now moved to 20th and Market. Right outside the CVS.
- Way too much garlic! Not worth the wait! I prefer mama's up the street!
- Glad to see he's still doing it! Just rated as the top food truck in Pennsylvania
- Get here early!
- A nice picture
- Gus makes great, quality food. Also, love the tunes.
- There is no menu because there is only one thing served and one price: some variant of chix/falafel/hummus/rice.  Sometimes w/fruit or salad or neither.  You can 86 the chix if you're a vegetarian.  $10.  That's it.  He's been there for years and it's always been the same.  Get over your fear!
- EXCELLENT food!!!! Just don't ask him any questions!!! I've never been disappointed.

Reviews:

- Gus has the best food truck around. His chicken, falafel, and whatever he feels like making that day is to die for! We literally go straight to his cart every time we visit Philly. Gus is a character! He is a hard worker with amazing cooking skills!!! You will not be disappointed!! (5 stars)

- Twas a few days before Christmas and all through the center city streets, were food trucks and cafes, and so many places to eat. On the Octopus falafel truck, random evviges hung on the window with care. And magically a line full of people appeared. This is the only food truck in the history of time, doesn't tell you what in your platter for $9.99. 

Ok, that's all I got lol 

But in all seriousness I think the allure of never knowing what you'll get, but also knowing that it'll be amazing 99% of the time makes it worth the adventure if you happen to be nearby and miss that first wave of a line. On this day I received a mix of grilled cherries and chicken with broccoli rabe.

 I did see him kick almost someone out of line for asking too many questions like, "Hey could you give me more falafel than chicken?" Uh, uh.. You never ask him questions unless he feels like talking to you. It's quite the experience, honestly lol (5 stars)
