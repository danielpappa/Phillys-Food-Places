Tips:

- In Tria We Trust. I have yet to be disappointed with any dish or beverage here. Always fresh and full of flavor - highly recommend the Bruschetta: Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey (though may work best as a dessert rather than appetizer).

Staff is extremely knowledgeable, ask any and all questions - better yet, take them up on their suggestions based on what you're looking for!

Reviews:

- I have gone here a few times. Most recently went with a friend. She forgot her vaccine card so we couldn't eat inside, but they seated us in an outdoor booth and made us feel very welcome and at home. Everybody went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. We had really nice drinks and the panini I had was excellent. Such nice people who are delivering an excellent service. I can't recommend this place higher or the people who run it. I am so grateful that they gave us a lovely evening. (5 stars)
