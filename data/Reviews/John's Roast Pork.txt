Category: Sandwiches, Salad, American (Traditional), Cheesesteaks, Breakfast & Brunch, Active Life, American (New), Beaches, Restaurants

Tips:

- Watch it, they have special prices for some customers! Not worth the price any more!
- Park in the back corner of the Lowe's parking lot. Just a quick walk from there, and you don't have to worry about street parking.
- Cash only
- There is a shorter line for the roast beef and roast pork sandwiches once you get inside.
- Best cheesesteak I've ever had ($8.50). And amazing roast pork obviously ($6 for a small).
- Unique and amazing!
- Yup, one of the best cheesesteaks in the city known for cheesesteaks.
- Bruschetta Cheesesteak.

Know what you want before you go in.
- April- Dec: They're open Saturdays 9-4
- now open on Saturdays! and there's a film crew here
- Best roast beef sandwich, ever!
- Amazing! Get your butt down here and eat a sandwich!

- Best roast pork in the city. Second best cheese steak. Wish they were open later.

- did not like it
- Great cheesesteak!
- This place is freakn awesome...
- When they scream out your name, you're not in trouble. .. You'll appreciate the end result
- Order ahead.  Waited for 30mins while the people waiting in the restaurant were ignored to fulfill 30+ to go orders. Not cool. There were only 3 of us waiting. Could have easily got ours out while making sandwiches for people who weren't there yet... Very frustrating
- Forget cheesesteaks. When in Philly, come here first, roast pork. Get it, even if you have to have one of your Johns pay for it.
- They only take orders through the phone right now. You'll receive a pick up time and I recommend arriving a little before your pick up time. When you arrive you'll see a make shift counter at their entrance. Someone may not be at this window, but around your pick up time they'll call names on the loudspeaker and this is when someone will come to the window and check you out.
- Cash only.
- Honestly the best meal we have eaten since moving to Philadelphia.
- One of the top roast pork places in the city or anywhere. Awesome food in a small joint. A required stop.
- Probably the best roast pork in Philadelphia. Plus they just expanded their hours to 7pm. If you've missed out in the past head on in now!!!
- I never knew pork in a sandwich could be this tender and juicy. Outstanding!
- Bring your 'tude when you come here if your a first timer, especially from out of state. You'll be fed super Philly attitude before your food is made. Just the way I'd expect from a dive like this!!
- PACKED on Thursday at noon
- Open Saturday 9-4!
- Yelp is wrong, they're open on Saturdays from 9 AM - 4 PM.

- The food is eh. Most people come for the cheesesteak. The workers hate their life
- best cheese steak in the city. enough said.
- Call ahead. If the line is to the door, you might wait 30 mins for a cheesesteak. Call in your order and cut the line. Warning: people don't like it when you cut the line but you'll be eating while they're still waiting.
- Cheesesteaks take forever, but roast pork sandwiches are ready immediately, so plan accordingly.
- Not in the best of neighborhoods.  Probably a good idea that they close at 3pm.
- John's accepts credit cards and mobile payments.
- If it's good enough for the James Beard foundation, it's good enough for me!

- Good luck eating here if you're from out of town. I've been here 3x but they've only been open once. Either closed on a weekday or plumbing issues. Whatever the excuse it's like they don't want me to come back to enjoy a cheesesteak.

- One of the famous traditional Phily style pork sandwiches spots as well as the cheesesteak and breakfast sandwiches but for me, the pork was under seasoned and honestly there was very little flavor from the cheese as well. Friendly staff and a James Beard award but I won't try the pork again. Maybe I'll have better luck with a breakfast or cheesesteak sandwich next time I go back

Reviews:

- I'm randomly in this area often and have passed John's Roast Pork a bunch of times. I finally stopped by for a Philly cheesesteak. It was during the weekday in the afternoon. The line was shockingly short. #winning

I was super excited to order a Philly cheesesteak. I haven't tried one in yearssss. If I'm not mistaken, I think my last exploration for a Philly cheesesteak was Geno's.

The Philly cheesesteak was pretty good. I just asked the cashier to give me the original. Since I'm no cheesesteak fanatic -- I don't really have anything to compare it to. The bread had sesame seeds on it and was soft but not soggy. The meat was seasoned decently. The fries was not all that. I'm assuming they put all of their energy into the cheesesteak lol.

I enjoyed the Philly cheesesteak and definitely would go again. I think I'm going to try another spot in the near future to compare the two. (4 stars)

- Born and raised in Texas, and had to stop at this establishment as part of my lifelong dream of seeing an Eagles game at the Linc! They had a limited menu due to staff and ingredient shortages, but still had an amazing experience. Definitely not an expert on Philly cheesesteaks, but there's no doubt that this place is high on the list. (5 stars)
