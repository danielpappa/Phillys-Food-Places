Tips:

- One of the better ramen place in Philly.

- If you want to skip the lunch rush, come right when it opens at 11:30! By the time it is noon, the restaurant will already be full and you'll have to wait 20 minutes.
- What can I say, I love this place
- Try the pork buns
- I think people like this place so much with their opened kitchen! It's nice to see what you get to put in your stomach!
- Good Japanese restaurant.
- Better to dine in. We ordered take out. But was cold and rubbery once we got home. The taste was still delicious so I'm sure it'll be even better consistency in house! Can't wait to go back for a re-try!
- Everything here is perfect: especially if this is ur first ever Ramen
- They've got vegan ramen, and it's amazing. Not on the menu but ask for veggie with straight noodles!

- Steaming hot bowl of ramen tastes great on a chilly fall day
- Come during non-rush times and enjoy the food to its heightened peak without the wait! Servers won't be as busy and, thus, will be able to give you more attention then. Trust me, the servers are usually very kind and helpful when they're not swamped.

- Amazing ramen.
- Spicy ramen - so good! (Not for those with shellfish allergy)
- Great noodles
- Lunch specials until 330 mon-sat.
- A bit salty. The soup isn't creamy enough. The ginger is too strong.
- Sit by the bar.
- Great food but terrible service. Waiters tried to rush us out in the middle of our meal on a non-busy Monday night. My two-cents: don't sit near the door; they think you'll try to leave without paying so they rush you eating.
- BYOB!!!!!
- Very good ramen, authentic. But the karaage curry was just ok.
- Strongly recommend!! Especially the appetizers and curry chicken rice~
- $8 minimum per person and $10 card minimum-- not too difficult to reach
- still delicious!!!
- Spicy ramen here is the best I've had anywhere. Usually a wait but worth it.
- Love all of their ramen!!! And the chicken katsu is awesome.
- I love the homemade roasted garlic.  The service here is five stars considering it's a very busy place. They constantly filled out water glasses.
- I highly recommend bibim ramen because it taste a lot like bibimbap. They taste a lot better if u eat them during the summer.
- 25 min wait on Monday should sum it up
- The best spot out there.
- The pork belly were good and the noodles were awesome! Great , fresh flavor!
- The Mini Karaage Curry Rice Bowl for $2.50 is so worth it! You can order it as a side with any of the Ramen or Udon.
- Too salty and the soup isn't creamy enough. Too much ginger flavor.
- Not too bad. Like their curry!
- The host here is the rudest host I've ever seen....
- One regular ramen is enough for a girl.
- Best ramen I've ever had!
- Don't know if this place doesn't live up to my expectation or i was sick so I became picky. Very normal. I ordered the house special one. The pork they put there smells like frozen meat. The broth has very little taste. I'd rather pay extra bus ticket to have a better ramen experience in NYC.
- Food is good.

 One 40ish year like waitress is so mean. Such a b*tch
- Would go with Takoyaki best thing in the place.
- Worst sever ever. Poor attitudes and soso food quality.
- mayu ramen is goodÔºÅ
- Still the best bowl of spicy ramen you can get in Philly.
- Ramen in winter! Any day
- Nice and clean best place in town for ramen
- ! !^^
- Servers are super friendly!
- Worst server ever. Put the wrong order and even yelled at us. Extremely rude.
- Not as good as ramen places in NYC.. I got the terawaka ramen and it didnt meet my expectation. The noodle itself was different and the broth was not flavorful enough. I will be exploring other ramen places in Philly.
- Try the karaage chicken app!!
- Katsu don! Best I've ever had. Chicken cutlet, egg, & rice. Sounds plain on paper, but tastes amaaaazing.
- Some of the best ramen in the city. BYOB.
- Fantastic authentic Japanese food!
- Really good taste ramon! Must try, then you will love it
- Wow. Just wow. Tried three different ones. Blown away.
- Get ready to wait in line for 30mins and nobody come to and ask for what you need. Bad service with little patience.
- Had the signature ramen - delicious :)
- The worst service ever
- Was in the mood for some sort of noodle soup, so I headed down to Chinatown and let my stomach guide me, and ended up here. The place is small, very lively, and the decor is nice. I had the Takoyaki and Spicy Terakawa Ramen. The tokoyaki was only ok, the octopus was ok, and the bonito on top was in really long strips, as opposed to the flakes you typically see. The ramen was perfect! Delicious broth, good veggies, and great pork. Would def reccomend
- Great Japanese food done right in Chinatown! Definitely a favorite of mine.
- Try the shrimp tempura shumai!
- In my humble opinion, this is the only place in Philadelphia you should go to get ramen.
- Great TanTan soup!!! Great Flavors!!!!
- I love this place. It really feels like I'm in the hidden leaf village or a cool little spot in Tokyo!
- Tried several bowls of ramen and the pork belly buns. It was my first time at a ramen joint and I was not disappointed. Everything was delicious. Take me back to NYC!!
- Started off with takoyaki and pork buns. Presentation, texture and flavor were excellent for both appetizers. Pork buns are filled with succulent portions of pork belly, yum! Had the miso ramen (requested less salty broth- highly recommend) and chicken katsu with rice. Will definitely come back for more and try the rest of the menu...
- Best ramen in philly, great size, great staff, byob.
- Never go to this place. Service sucks. Rating here is a fraud.

- The best noodle shop in Philly
- Very good and vegan friendly. Very small inside so get there early.
- This place is always packed!! Great ramen. I recommend the terakawa and miso ramen. The noodle is extremely fresh and probably hand drawn. There is great efficiency for a very small place. So even though the line is out the door, the wait time is not too long.

Reviews:

- My favorite ramen spot in Philly. Usually get the signature Tonkatsu ramen & it is consistently good every time. This time tried the chicken katsudon and it was also good as well. They do check for vaccine cards so be ready when they ask you. 

Waited 20-30 minutes to get seated but they have an efficient wait system of checking in at the door using their Yelp kiosk. Wish they had wait times & queue line up in the app. Could save you time if you are on the way and save you a phone call to the restaurant.

Anyways, it was a great experience. Food came out pretty quick considering how busy they were (10-15 min) and are waiter was quick to get us what we needed.

Pleasant surprise was how much noodles we received when ordering an extra noodle. Great portion for $2.50.

Tip : Watch your phone closely when they text your table is ready. Saw some groups miss their turn since they only hold it for 5 minutes. (5 stars)

- Although grabbing a table here is difficult, it is all worth it for the value.  Every bowl is made with crazy flavor and garnishing, it is difficult to find the right thing for you.  I ordered the terrakawa ramen special, and it's always a solid choice for me because its delicious and filling.  Service may take a while, so come on a day you're free. (4 stars)

- This is definitely the best ramen chain in Philly. The broth is very rich and flavorful, and, I daresay, better than some of the chains in NYC. 

Both the Chinatown and the University City locations are very good, but wait times can be a bit long depending on time of day. We went to the Chinatown location on a Sunday night and it took about 50 minutes to get a table after putting our names down - still totally worth a visit though! (5 stars)

- We arrived around 11:40 am. First time here and found it to be friendly, spotless and delicious. My favorite ramen is spicy ramen. (4 stars)

- Great place. Food is delicious and somehow always find parking tight in front. This is my lucky happy spot. (5 stars)

- Was excited to try this place as it was a highly rated ramen place in Philly area. We were immediately seated when walking in and they have a lot of covid precautions including temperature measuring and hand sanitizing. The service was amazing - my water was always filled and they are very attentive with you being done with your food (not rushed though!!). I got the mayu ramen - which is the pork bone broth with extra garlic flavor and it was really yummy!!! The broth was delicious (i would still rather have a thicker more flavorful broth but that is personal preference) and I LOVE garlic so this was perfect. The ramen is also highly customizable with spicy level and saltiness and noodle firmness. The egg wasn't the best - it was too sweet but it wasn't over cooked. The pork was also okay i think it could have been more soft (since there are some fatty and meaty parts so the meat part was more tough). The buns were so delicious the server recommended the fried buns and it didn't disappoint!! Overall I would still recommend!

TLDR: 
Food is 4/5
Service is 5/5
Recommend fried pork buns and ramen has pretty decent broth, toppings are ok, customizable though! (4 stars)

- I took my brother here before a Sixers game. It was a cool evening - perfect for a piping hot bowl of ramen. My brother and I have tried multiple kinds of ramen in a few different Japanese towns, so our expectations are pretty high. Terakawa Ramen did not disappoint whatsoever.

We started with the Takoyaki (a fried batter ball stuffed with octopus covered in Kewpie mayo and bonito flakes - a tradition japanese street food) and Karaage chicken (deliciously crispy friend chicken). Both were authentic and amazing - a perfect start for a phenomenal meal.

I got the signature ramen. Once I started to dig in, I barely stopped to take a breath of air. The broth was creamy, rich, salty and flavorful. The noodles were chewy and perfectly cook. The charsu pork was the definition of "melt-in-your-mouth" - might be some of the best I've ever had.

The service was friendly, and the ambiance was amazing. It reminded me of walking into a ramen shop in Japan. Located in the heart of Chinatown, I'm excited I found Terakawa Ramen and to make it one of my go to spots in Philly. (5 stars)

- Really good food, but service was okay. Hostess was dismissive, but the food was great! (4 stars)
