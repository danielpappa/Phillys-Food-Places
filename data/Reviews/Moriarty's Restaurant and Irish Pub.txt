- Wow. I've never been so insulted in my life. After telling the bartender that our beer was 2 months past expiration (see picture) we were yelled at and insulted. He then dumped out all of our drinks that we had just paid for and still ran our credit cards!! The management of this bar is a joke... But hopefully it won't be around long considering how many underage kids they serve. I used to love this place but ill never go back.

- Moriartys is my favorite place in the city. Their bartenders and servers and friendly and always great. My coworkers and I end up there at least 3 nights a week and even when it's late the staff is full of smiles. Two of their bartenders Josephine and Harry are adorable and always make me smile.
- Best wings in the city! I've tried just about everywhere and these are by far the best. An order of 10 wings

- Golden monkey ... Mmmmm
- Dark Irish bar with lots of beer an whiskey. Food leaves lots to be desired.
- Awesome wings!!!
- Food took too long to come out, and they weren't even busy.. not happy
- It could've been just your average urban Irish pub but the great service made all the difference.
- Love Monday's when my favorite bartender Harry's working , STELLA !!!!!!!!!!!
- Iroquois apartments
- This place sucked.  Do not be confused.  This is a beer and shot joint.  You will be  surrounded by a bunch of newly 21 year olds talking about their high school days.  Go somwhere else to get a meal. The barteders are cute.  However, a nice pair of tits does not mean good service.
- Center City Sips & Happy Hour have great deals!
