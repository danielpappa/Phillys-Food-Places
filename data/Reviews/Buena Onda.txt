Tips:

- Half price margaritas on Tuesday!
- They have a bar, selective stuff. Margaritas I think. You don't have to wait in line if it's a long line, you can sit at the bar and order at lunch! Also, don't want to pay for a bottle of water, ask for a cup!

Reviews:

- I just moved to the area and this was on my carefully researched list of food places to try. 

I got the breaded fish tacos, a carne taco, and the pork taco. The ingredients seemed fresh and they certainly looked pretty. However the flavor was just missing that punch of goodness I'm used to. Perhaps I'm spoiled from having lived in California. There was no spice, no lime flavor, no....anything special.

I don't think I'll try this place again. I've heard this coast doesn't do tacos well? Not sure yet, but this was a big disappointment.

The place was clean, the staff was attentive and kind, and everything had a beautiful presentation. (3 stars)

- Love the atmosphere.. fun, festive, great margs, and superb baja fish tacos.   My fav thing i tried might have been the nachos though.  So good and they actually spread the toppings out, so you aren't left with a pile of tortilla chips after 5 good bites!  Def will be back! (5 stars)
