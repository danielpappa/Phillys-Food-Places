Reviews:

- I thought it'd be better because it's always packed and ppl rave about the brunch. Food was underwhelming and the bill was ridiculous. (2 stars)

- Not it for me. It was highly overpriced for a small amount of food. I think people mostly go for the name. I would prefer a larger portion at a smaller price. I am really sick of these fancy named restaurants getting away with subpar food and overpriced menus. (2 stars)
