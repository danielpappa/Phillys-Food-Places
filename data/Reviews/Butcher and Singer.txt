Reviews:

- Solid steakhouse in the heart of center city. Barmen consistently demonstrate their knowledge of building pleasure through flavor. The mastery at the broiler and grill will not disappoint you. The room's two-story ceiling brings memories of grand days gone by, once a bank lobby? So cool. 

BAR
Liquor list features many local Pennsylvania brands, and if you're daring, ask your barman to make you one that takes you off the beaten path!
Mine was my simple sapphire martini ($20), in and out, twist, stirred. Excellent. 

SERVICE
Tuxedoed servers and staff are the norm, and the formal style of service is the standard at steakhouses like this across the nation. 

AMBIENCE
Dishwasher station is busy and loud. The "plate clanking" and pot banging volume is quite high, as is the symphonic buzz of kitchen printers heralding your order in concert. It would make a marvelous background-noise track, "busy restaurant"! I'd certainly buy it for my Apple TV!

Music tracks overhead are a mix of big band and fast trio jazz, accented by bursts of trumpet and scatty Singers. 

But my favorite is the discreet sculpture of a bull's head with horns, mounted at the center of the far wall. Ha!

THE COURSE
Tonight's oysters ($19)  were huge, creamy samples from Maryland, and some delightful briny ones from Massachusetts. 
The mignonette was wonderfully chunky at the bottom, not the watery vinegar with "floaty bits" one usually gets elsewhere. Great flavor. 
And the horseradish was freshly shaved, airy, and dare I say, light? also a special treat.  

The 8oz filet mignon ($46), "black and blue" arrived perfectly hard-hard-broiled and then raw and cold in the center. 
Not that charcoal shoe-leather black you get from the chef to punish you for ordering "well done", just perfectly done. Bravo!
The warm plate brought up the temp so it was cool instead of cold as I made my way through it, Wow!
I added some finishing salt to each bite, and realized this is truly the way to enjoy a steak. This size. This way.  
The delectable mushrooms and onions ($12) side was the perfect accompaniment. 

Finishing sweetly was a delightful baked pear sorbet ($9) and Calvados ($20) digestif. 

BUT THE BUGS
Special flying insect friends were companions tonight, interested in  beverages, the butter and bread and more. They only swarmed every five minutes or so, but Shucks!
Honestly with more "pre

BOBBLING ALONG
On a more personal note, with my E-badge not renewed for '22 after 13 in a row and 14 in the community, I must admit some relief that I can now review more casually, tell more of a personal story, and without the pressure that "mine will appear before others, so I had _better_ be "just the facts ma'am" concise,  do it right, and not waste your time with rambling!l" 
Now I know that these will disappear into the babbling swath of bobbleheads, never to be noticed, well, except for you followers and dear friends from so very many years together!! 
Let me know if you line this more narrative casual style better. (4 stars)

- I somehow ignored my addiction to the dry-aged ribeyes at Del Frisco's and finally tried this old school Center City gem! Boy was I NOT disappointed! Fantastic food and excellent, friendly (even funny) service!

Our Porterhouse for Two was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was super-flavorful! Our stuffed hash browns and creamed spinach sides were delicious! And the biscuits were so good -- buttery, flakey, melt in your mouth good -- that we ordered a second basket!

And then I saw it...

The dessert menu had BAKED ALASKA!

I was like: "No, way! They have Baked Alaska!?!?" This is like the dessert of legends -- an after dinner delicacy I've only heard about and read about, but have never actually seen on any menu anywhere. In fact, I think it's one of those ancient American desserts that went the way of the dinosaur back in the late 1960s (along with Sinatra-era treats like Clams Casino), never to be seen on an American menu again...UNTIL NOW! But to be honest, when I read about this dessert years ago, I was like: "Why would anyone think ice cream baked into a meringue is even a good idea?" But I LOVED IT! Never tasted a merengue this good! And the apricots!

So, yeah, it will now become easier to stave off the Del Frisco's habit if this place is the steak destination (meaning, they will see me again).

Biscuits w/ Honey Butter: 5/5
Tuna Tartare: 5/5
Porterhouse Steak for Two: 5/5
Creamed Spinach: 5/5
Stuffed Hashbrown: 5/5
Baked Alaska: 5/5
Blackberry Cosmopolitan: 4/5 (5 stars)

- Appetizers were good, drinks were average but entree's were subpar especially King Salmon which was bland and soggy. Staff was responsive, took a note and got it off our check. Overall, not worth the buck. (3 stars)

- This is hands down my favorite steak in Philly. It's inside is an old bank so the place is old school and really neat to sit and eat. (5 stars)

- Food was incredible, best filet I have ever had.  The green beans are incredible.  Basically anything you order is worth it.  Perfect for a date night (5 stars)

- I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday on a Friday evening a month in advance and we were both very excited to try out Butcher and Singer! We were promptly seated in a nice, private table - which I appreciate for a steakhouse where they usually pack you in like sardines. We brought a special bottle of wine for the occasion (corkage fee I think is $30) and ordered appetizers - Mac and cheese and Caesar salad. Both were delicious as were the complimentary biscuits. My boyfriend ordered the bone-in delmonico, I ordered the bone-in filet, and we shared the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Dinner and appetizers all came out with perfect timing and we're delicious! This is where things started to go downhill. We began eating our dinner and within 30 minutes we're done and ready to have things boxed up. We sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for our server... we watched other tables have their server check on them multiple times and the person filling our water came by probably 5 times. We finally asked the man filling our water to box up our meals as we had already been there 2 hours and had somewhere to be. Finally, our server came by and when we didn't order dessert, made us feel bad (believe me, dessert and espresso martinis are my favorite part of a meal so we usually would have ordered). For a place where you are dropping $100+ per person, I am beyond disappointed with the service. (3 stars)
