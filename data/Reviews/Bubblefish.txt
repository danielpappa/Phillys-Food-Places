- 4 credit cards max per table
- Monday-Friday 11:00-3:00 pm special : 2 hand roll for 7.95$ except the signature roll
- Always polite and professional. The rolls and especially the taco is my favorite.
- Take a chance on the sea salt froth lychee green tea.. Add grass jelly. Delicious!
- Stopped in an ordered something on my break from Lyft and decided to try one of their bubble teas. Mango yogurt tea didn't sound so bad so I thought I'd give it a try. Delishhhh...
- Lunch sushi special for $7.95. 2 rolls
- The spicy garlic edamame was the highlight of my meal!
- Gets better every time... Best sushi in Philly!

- Recently in the Good Taste feature (10/26) in the Inquirer by Craig Laban for their Taiwanese Fried Chicken!
- You can adjust the sweetness of each drink! I always tone down my mango smoothie by asking for 50% sugar.
- I Always get the sushi and tea. There is So much tea to choose from it will entice to come back every time I'm in China town.
- This is really low quality sushi. Made for high school kids who love bubble tea.
- They don't take cards, so make sure to bring cash!
- Did dine in and found the food much improved! Decor is beautiful too
- It was just okay
- My favorite sushi place so far. Price is reasonable but expect a faster service.
- Try the wings, they are really good!
- Sushi orders can be slow during peak times. 7p Wed reservation, ordered ~7:10p didn't get food until ~7:45p.
- Hot day? Highly recommend the Very Mango! Mango shake with orange juice and mango bubble pops. $5.25. Big enough to share - refreshing take out! :)
- Wasn't a huge fan. The quality of the fish was poor. I threw away most of my order.
- Food is O.K. Service is not good.
- Wasn't a huge fan
- I prefer the non-sushi items on the menu more.  I think the salmon taco is too sweet.  Taiwanese or cooked dishes are pretty tasty
- $15 minimum for credit card. Beware!
- Although their Chirashi is my favorite, the salt baked chicken appetizer with sea salt froth lemon tea combination is my favorite too! Love this place a lot! They have everything I like!
- Delicious and very reasonably priced
- Probably the best milk tea at Philly, so delicious! A place you must go and try

- Lunch specials do not apply on holiday weekdays.
- Amazing food! Must try the Hot Ginger Milk tea
- They open late! Good place to have a cup of tea drink or a nice meal!
- Great environment, great food and drinks. Even open in the snow storm.
- Haven't been to too many places, but this is one of the best I have ever had.

- Don't get the angry roll. It's not good. Mango and shrimp and tempura do not go well together.  I should have gotten the Godzilla or Marilyn roll.
- The spicy garlic edamame is enough for me to order at least twice a week.
- Bubble fish
- Pretty sure they catch the fish while you're waiting. And waiting. And waiting.
- So so good
- Get the spicy garlic edamame. So good.
- Outstanding

Reviews:

- Got the spicy maki combo. ABSOLUTELY delicious and came with a  spicy mayo sauce. 8 pieces in a roll - spicy tuna, spicy crab and spicy salmon. All smooth and delicious. Got it delivered and fees weren't bad. Will definitely order again! (4 stars)

- Pros
- the food was delicious and food portions were great! Loved their tonkatsu don and eel avocado onigiri! 
- everything was packaged nicely for our pick up order
- reasonable price for the dishes
- great variety in their menu
- clear and visible restaurant sign making it easy to find in Chinatown 

Cons
- we ordered pick up and our order took almost double the amount of time they said on the phone. We came in after 25 minutes to pick up our food and they said it would take another 20 minutes. No apology. Several others came in after me and they said the same thing about their order being delayed..so they need to work on the accuracy of their wait time!
- they have drinks on their menu but they don't do to go orders for them :( (4 stars)
